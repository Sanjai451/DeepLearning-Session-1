The circles should span from about your chin to your waist.[5]It is important for the circles to be the same size. Oftentimes, beginners struggle with one arm and are more comfortable with the other.

For example, if you are on the right-hand side of the turner, jump in when the rope in their left hand hits the ground. Try this a few times with the turners until you are comfortable making a seamless entrance.If you are struggling to enter into the middle, you can mark the middle with tape or chalk. This way you will have a target to aim for as you enter.If you are having a hard time entering, you can try starting in the middle before the turners begin to rotate the ropes.

You could even rotate while jumping to gradually turn around in a circle. The possibilities are endless!Try jumping on only one leg and then switching to the other. To stay on balance, pick out a stationary point of focus and stare at it. This will help you to stay centered while you switch legs so that you arent swayed by the swinging ropes or moving people.To rotate while jumping, start by making a quarter turn and land on both feet.

How to Feed Sand Crabs: 7 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Understand how sand crabs behave in the wild.,"They burrow into the littoral sand where the tide meets the shore, and they scavenge most of their food from what they find buried in the sand. The term ""sand crab"" describes a variety of large (often predatory) and small (often scavenging) species, and you must suit any feeding regimen to your particular crab. Consider the differences between large and small sand crabs:Larger sand crabs tend to feed on live or decaying prey that they find while burrowing. This prey may include smaller crabs, baby turtles, and the carcasses of dead shorebirds. As larger crabs burrow, they aerate the sand. This helps to keep air and water circulating in their habitats.[1]Smaller sand crabs feed on mollusks, worms, plankton, and algae. They are mostly scavengers: they keep their ecosystem clear of decomposing organic matter, which could host harmful bacteria."
How to Feed Sand Crabs: 7 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Observe how sand crabs naturally feed.,"The crabs bury themselves in the sand, facing the ocean, with only their eyes and front antennae exposed. When the tide recedes and washes over them, they unfurl a second set of antennae that filter tiny plankton from the water. The movement happens very quickly. Thus, a sand crab can gather several morsels from each receding wave.[2]Most crabs can move in any directionforward, backward and sidewaysbut a sand crab moves only backward. Thus, it must position itself carefully to reap its meals from the waves."
How to Feed Sand Crabs: 7 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Know the mating habits of sand crabs.,"In the wild, mating occurs mostly in spring and summer. A female may produce as many as 45,000 eggs. She carries them on her abdomen until the eggs hatch  about 30 days later. For two to four months, the larvae drift as plankton, and currents can carry them far across the sea.[3]Sand crabs can reproduce during their first year of life if the water is warm enough. They don't usually live longer than two to three years."
How to Feed Sand Crabs: 7 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Consider the challenges of removing sand crabs from the wild.,"They are saltwater shore-dwellers, and they need high temperatures to survive.

Furthermore, sand crabs feed on such a diverse diet that you may have a hard time giving them the variety they're used to."
How to Feed Sand Crabs: 7 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Set up a tank with fresh beach sand and seawater.,"In the wild, sand crabs bury themselves deep in wet sand and catch plankton with their antennae. Replicate this process by filling your crab's habitat with beach sand, then pouring seawater over the sand a few times each day. Use any glass aquarium. Bear in mind that sand crabs cannot dig in sand that is too dry or densely-packed.[4]Try to bring the beach sand directly from the ecosystem where you got the crab. Local beach sand is more likely to contain the insects and microorganisms that your crab needs.Sand crabs naturally gather in shoals, so it should be okay to put several sand crabs in the same tank. Remember, however, that large crabs like to eat smaller crabs."
How to Feed Sand Crabs: 7 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Regularly refill the tank with seawater.,"Homemade saltwater will not do; it needs to contain algae and plankton. You can buy plankton, algae, and aquarium-grade seawater at some aquarium-supply and exotic pet stores. Be warned that these supplies can be expensive.[5]Understand that this tactic is a short-term experiment to study the behavior of a sand crab. It is not necessarily a sustainable, long-term way to keep a sand crab as a pet. If you only need to study the sand crab for a short time, consider returning it to the wild when you're done."
How to Feed Sand Crabs: 7 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Consider getting a hermit crab instead.,"Sand crabs are difficultsometimes nearly impossibleto keep as pets. If you are looking for a crab that's easy to raise and feed, consider getting a hermit crab. Do your research, create a habitat, and learn to care for hermit crabs.[6]Aquarium hermit crabs thrive on practically any food, from algae and leftover fish food to beef, eggs, and vegetables. In the wild, hermit crabs have been known to eat leaves, fruit, and even wood. You can also buy commercial hermit crab food that mimics the crab's natural diet."

How to Deal with Passive Aggressive Relatives: 9 Steps,Observe your relatives.,"See if you can identify the passive-aggressive behaviors they're displaying. Be careful to take into account occasional lapsesfrom time to time we all behave passive-aggressively because of stress, exhaustion, fear, or lack of assertiveness. The behavior becomes problematic when it's a person's constant mode of communication. Some signs to look for include:[1]What is this relative saying? Complaining is a typical sign of passive-aggressive behavior. For example, complaints about being unappreciated and about their own misfortunes tend to be commonplace.What is this relative doing? On the one hand, the relative seems to agree with you, then lo and behold, you discovered he or she went and did things completely the opposite!How does the relative respond to new information or to the choices that you (or your siblings, cousins, etc.) have made in your life? Feigning disinterest or even outright ignoring the news, or criticizing or scorning your achievements under layers of ""wit"", sarcasm or joke cracking can be a sign of passive aggressive behavior. The passive aggressive person tends to distrust the success of others and will do a lot to downplay it or suggest that the success was a result of luck or cheating, rather than accepting that someone might have worked hard for it. It'll all be done very subtly though, so don't expect outright scorn.Does your relative express disapproval or withhold positive reinforcement? The inability to give praise or acknowledge a job well done is a sign of resentment, a key underpinning of passive aggressive behavior.Have you noticed the relative making snide comments but then acting as if he or she never said such a thing? Or even going so far as to accuse you of misinterpreting what has been said?Is your relative being argumentative over almost everything you say or suggest? A lot of ""back chat"" which insists that they have things worse, know better or shine brighter can make for a very negative pattern. For example, saying such things as: ""No, no, no, that's not the case"" or ""Well, in my experience, that never happens"" or ""In my day we didn't even have that sort of chance and had to work hard for our supper"", etc.Does your relative go on and on about how fortunate other people are and how unfortunate he or she is? Does this person use the dreaded words ""if only..."", then goes on to explain all that he or she could have done in life if all the stars had aligned correctly? In listening to this type of talk, it can soon feel that this person has an inability to accept that he or she has no responsibility for making beneficial changes in life."
How to Deal with Passive Aggressive Relatives: 9 Steps,"Ultimately, what is the relative doing that causes you to feel that he or she is using passive aggressive behavior towards you?","Most times it is very subtle, although the more a passive aggressive person responds this way, the more it feels ""natural"" to him or her and the more blatant it can become over time. Determine what you find disturbing about their behavior. Is it that they don't agree with you, or is it the way they express their disagreement, i.e. gritting their teeth silently, then saying ""it's fine, dear"" when you ask them what is wrong?"
How to Deal with Passive Aggressive Relatives: 9 Steps,Evaluate the motives behind your relative's behavior.,"You may or may not know ""the grand narrative"" behind why your relative behaves passive aggressively but you will probably get enough snippets of what has upset your relative through the things he or she says. This should enable you to start building a bigger picture of what ails the person. Determine what disturbs you about this person's outlook on life and his or her attitude towards others in the family, especially those who have achieved things that this person feels resentful about.[2]Why is the person acting this way? Is it possible that Aunt Flo wanted desperately to be a prima ballerina in her younger years but was too poor and married too young to achieve this ambition, only to see a grandchild doing really well at ballet? Maybe Uncle Georgy wanted to be an astronaut but found studying the needed subjects too arduous, only to find years later that a nephew has been accepted to NASA. These are not excuses, they are ways of understanding the narrative that the relative has built their current reality on.Do you think there is an understandable reason behind why your relative might not approve of something that is important to you? In some cases, a passive aggressive person is self-protecting initially from a bad experience but then projects this bad experience on loved ones in the hope of protecting them from a possible bad experience too. It can help to see that a gruff, scolding or nasty comment about your choices being wrong might well be coming from a place of care for you, however misplaced on their own personal bad experience.In some cases, the passive aggressive relative is seeking to control you, the situation, the family, etc. This person may feel that his or her place in the family is somehow threatened and that by being passive aggressive, a covert attempt is made to restore the relative's power over others. There may even be a sense of satisfaction in knowing that their words or behavior causes another distress or second thoughts.Another possible motive for passive aggressive behavior is simple jealousy. As with Aunt Flo and Uncle Georgy above, seeing someone else achieve in ways that the relative feels he or she has failed can be devastating and may even self-confirming of long-term failure to pursue dreams. In this case, resentment, bitterness and spite will likely fuel the motive behind the passive aggressive behavior."
How to Deal with Passive Aggressive Relatives: 9 Steps,"Be aware that one key motive behind passive aggressive behavior is to attack you, bring you down, pour scorn on you or show you up without retaliation coming back on the person.","This is why sarcasm, jokes, all-knowing statements and false wisdom will often be used as a way to suggest that ""no harm was meant"", even though harm was the full intent."
How to Deal with Passive Aggressive Relatives: 9 Steps,Don't let yourself become a part of the game play.,"The most important part of dealing with a passive aggressive relative (and family ties do make the emotional heartstrings tug harder), is learning to not get annoyed. Rehearse good thinking patterns in your head before you come into contact with the particular relative againa little mental role-playing can help you to avoid panicking and giving in to the subtle pressures.[3]Tell yourself something like: ""Granny is being passive aggressive again. I love her heaps but I won't let her mess with my head like this anymore. She is bitter about X but that won't impede me from doing what I have set out to do"". Or, ""Jon is being unfair and is trying to sabotage me by saying those things. I know he's behaving passive aggressively and if I get upset, he'll get what he wants. It won't change anything to worry or get annoyed about him. Instead, I'll either ignore the remarks or stand up for myself.""Above all, stay calm. It can be easy to feel agitated or upset but this makes it likely that your response will be emotionally driven rather than calmly considered. Being calm will unnerve the passive aggressive person.Try to keep your emotional guard up, especially around people who are frequently passive aggressive.[4]"
How to Deal with Passive Aggressive Relatives: 9 Steps,Confront the relative openly and politely.,"Once you conclude that passive aggressive behavior is your relative's way of communicating (or not communicating) with you, and that is bothersome to you, respond. Wait until your relative does or says something passive-aggressive. Then, in a calm and friendly manner, ask ""Why do you say that or do that?"". If your relative pretends that he or she didn't do anything, say ""You said or did (repeat what they said or did) just now. Do you not like my idea (or does my story bother you)?""[5][6]Putting the person on the spot may prevent them from making passive aggressive comments in the future. Usually, these types of people like to stay under the radar.[7]"
How to Deal with Passive Aggressive Relatives: 9 Steps,Share your own feelings.,"If your relative denies being bothered by anything, remain calm. Say something like: ""Well, when you said or did ... this made me feel rejected or silly, and it hurts my feelings."" This is a non-aggressive way to remain open to your relative and show him or her that the passive aggressive behavior matters to you. Your relative will then have to explain his or her actions.[8]Often, this is enough to encourage an open explanation or an apology, even if it is put forth in a gruff manner (i.e. ""I didn't mean to make you feel bad, I just worry about your finances or your future/etc."", or ""You know I love you, I don't have to say that all the time!"").Follow up with ""I'm really glad you told me that"" or something similar. This is a high-pressure situation for him or her, so appreciate the little steps your relative is taking."
How to Deal with Passive Aggressive Relatives: 9 Steps,Don't let your relative brush you off.,"If your relative retorts that you are just too sensitive, stand your groundthis sort of retort is a put-down and not reality. Tell your relative that you are genuinely interested in his or her opinion, even if he or she disagrees with you, and that you want your relative to be comfortable sharing thoughts with you. This will probably be surprising to your relative. Many passive-aggressive people act the way they do because they lack the confidence to express themselves and face possible disagreement. If you tell your relative that his or her opinion has value, he or she might drop the defensive behavior and slowly come to interact with you on eye level.[9]Always stick to facts. If necessary, keep a record in a small notebook, along with dates and the context.Be a broken record. If the relative tries to twist facts, deny things said or done, or blame another, simply reiterate what you know to be the case and what behavior you prefer.If needed, learn to be more assertive. Help can be found in such articles as How to be assertive and How to go from passive to assertive."

How to Face Problems in Your Life: 15 Steps,Acknowledge the problem.,"It can be tempting to stay away from the issue that is causing you problems. However, avoiding the problem does not help solve it.  Instead, accept that the problem exists and ask yourself some questions about it. What are the consequences of this problem? Who does it involve?[1]If you dont think you have a problem, but everyone tells you there is a problem, try to see if there is truth to it.If you are having trouble admitting you have a problem, you might be in denial. For example, if you dont want to accept that a close family member is involved with drugs, you might come up with other excuses for her behavior.While denial can be useful at times by protecting your mental health, it can in other cases lead you away from dealing with the problem head on.[2]In fact, avoidance often exacerbates the problem and doesnt provide any lasting relief. Avoiding your problem will continue to create a cycle of stress for you as it will always be weighing on the back of your mind.That said, sometimes a little escapism can be healthy. If you find yourself overwhelmed and stressed out, take a break! Watch a TV show or read a book, or engage in some other hobby you enjoy. You could even just zone out and let your mind wander![3]"

Sometimes you may not notice something until it has been going on for a long time. This might especially be true if your problem involves other people (e.g. your sister may have been involved with drugs for a long time before you noticed).If you think you know when the problem started, think about events that happened at that time.

An implication of not having enough money might be that you are stressed out and that you can't enjoy the kinds of things that you would like to.If the problem isn't something private, put the list somewhere you see it so you don't forget to act on it. For example, you might put it on your fridge."

Just write down everything that comes to mind and evaluate whether it is a good or bad solution later on.[13]Consider the anatomy of the problem. Usually a problem is not just one problem alone - it has consequences and affects other areas of your life. Which part of the problem do you think you should address first?For example, if your problem is that you never get to go on vacation, sub-problems may be that it is difficult for you to get time off of work, and it is difficult for you to save money to be able to afford a vacation.You could address these sub-problems separately: You could cut back on eating out while simultaneously talking to your boss about how you are burnt out and could use a week off, and make a case that you would ultimately be more productive in the long run if allowed to recuperate."
How to Face Problems in Your Life: 15 Steps,Evaluate your solutions.,"Ask yourself some questions that may help you decide whether to pursue one approach versus another. Ask yourself:[14]Whether the solution will, in fact, solve your problem.How efficient the solution is in terms of the time and other resources it will require.How you might feel it you choose that solution relative to another solution.What the costs and benefits of the solution are.Whether this solution has worked for others in the past."
How to Face Problems in Your Life: 15 Steps,Put your plan into action.,"Once you know what you want to do and youve gathered your resources, implement your solution and face your problem head on. If the first solution doesnt work, try your plan B or go back to the drawing board and make one. The important thing is to keep going until you've successfully conquered the problem.[15]As you engage in your plan, reward yourself for your small successes so you are more likely to stick with it when the going gets tough!Resist the temptation to avoid your problems if your plans dont work. Remember not to catastrophize just because one solution didn't solve the problem, that doesn't mean there isn't another method to solve your problem."

How to Be Quiet: 17 Pro Tips,Think before you speak.,"People who are naturally loud do not possess this important skill. So, the next time youre in a situation where youre just dying to say something, pause, take a moment, and ask yourself if what you have to say will really help the situation. Will you be giving people information that they need, making people laugh, or offering words of comfort, or will you be saying something just to be heard? If you dont think anyone will actually benefit from what you have to say, then keep it to yourself.[1]One rule to follow when youre starting off is to say one of every two things youre thinking. As you work on being more quiet, then you can say one of every three things, or one of every four things."
How to Be Quiet: 17 Pro Tips,Dont interrupt.,"Dont ever interrupt a person while he or she is talking unless you think what you have to say is crucial to the conversation. (Lets face it. When is that ever the case?) Not only is it rude to interrupt people, but it will disrupt the flow of the conversation and will make you look like a loudmouth. If you really have a comment to make or a question to ask, then make a note of it and wait until the other person is done talking to see if what you have to say is still relevant.[2]"
How to Be Quiet: 17 Pro Tips,Ask questions instead of talking about yourself.,"If youre working on being more quiet, then chances are that you tend to talk on and on about yourself or the things that really interest you instead of letting other people share their ideas. So, the next time youre having a conversation and its your turn to speak, ask people questions to gain insight about the topic youre discussing and to learn more about them, from what their hobbies are to what they like to do for fun.[3]You dont have to make it sound like an interrogation or ask questions that make people uncomfortable. Keep things light, friendly, and polite and remember that conversation, in large part, is more about saying that you care about and are interested in the other person's thoughts, feelings, and point of view and less about sharing your take on things."
How to Be Quiet: 17 Pro Tips,Count down from ten before you say something.,"If youve thought of the most amazing comment to make ever, give it ten seconds. Count down from ten to see if the idea suddenly sounds less appealing, or to give other people time to chime in and to keep you from saying what you wanted to say. This is also a great technique if youre feeling angry or upset and want to air your grievances. Giving yourself a little bit of time to calm down can keep you from saying something youll regret.When you become a pro at this, you can even just count down from five. Even that short amount of time can help you see whether or not you should keep quiet."
How to Be Quiet: 17 Pro Tips,Listen carefully.,"If you want to be quiet, then you have to work on being a great listener. When someone is talking to you, make eye contact, pick up on important points, and try to read between the lines to figure out what the person is really saying and how he or she is really feeling. Let the person talk, dont lose patience, and dont fall victim to distractions like text messages.[4]The more you work on being a good listener, the less compelled you will be to dominate the conversation. A good rule of thumb is to balance your talking and listening time, to make them equal. A balanced conversation is the most healthy."
How to Be Quiet: 17 Pro Tips,Stop complaining.,"[5] If you find yourself spending a lot of your conversation time running down a litany of things that annoyed you today, the horrible traffic you faced this morning, the nasty email you got from a friend, how the cold this winter is crimping your style. It might help if you consider what responses are on the table for the other person. Where can the conversation go? Will anything productive result? What might the other feel about you and the attitude your words reflects?If complaining about the things you cant change really makes you feel better, then try writing them down in your journal. Theres really no need to complain out loud, is there?If you have a real problem and need to talk about it, thats fine. What were talking about here is your need to complain just for the sake of conversation."
How to Be Quiet: 17 Pro Tips,Focus on your breath.,"If you really feel antsy and want to start talking for no reason, just focus on your breath. Pay close attention to the rising and falling of your breath and work on breathing more deeply and evenly. Stop fidgeting and listen to whats happening around you. Focus on how youre thinking and feeling instead of on whatever it is you want to say so badly.This technique will calm you down and will make you see that talking isnt so important."
How to Be Quiet: 17 Pro Tips,Take time to process what you hear.,"You may be the kind of person who has an instant reaction to something that you hear and who wants to immediately blurt out everything that youre thinking, wondering, sort of wondering, but this really isnt the best way to tackle the situation. If you take the time to process whatever is happening and to fully form a question or a comment, then youll be able to speak much less and to ask or say something that is much more spot-on.[6]This will give you time to be your own internal editor and to not let out all of the extra stuff that isnt doing anyone any good."
How to Be Quiet: 17 Pro Tips,Find a hobby that requires quiet.,"Practicing being quiet on your own can help you be more quiet when youre around people. One way to get some great practice being quiet is to find a hobby where you have to be quiet and preferably by yourself. Try painting, creative writing, yoga, song writing, stamp collecting, bird watching, or really anything at all that requires you to be quiet and to not say whatever is on your mind. Reading is also great for helping you be quiet as you process the words in front of you.Try going at least an hour without saying anything while youre pursuing your hobby. Then go for two hours. Then three hours. Think you can go a whole day without saying a word?"
How to Be Quiet: 17 Pro Tips,Release your energy in other ways.,"You may be talking a lot, some may say too much because you feel like you have so much energy and dont know how to release it. So, find another outlet for saying all of the things on your mind that can help you get rid of all that extra stuff going on in your head.Working out, especially running can help you get some great exercise while getting rid of that extra energy. So can taking long walks or cooking. Find whatever works for you."
How to Be Quiet: 17 Pro Tips,Fight the temptation to chat online.,"Talking online only fills your life with noise and most of what you say isnt really that important. If you really wanted to talk to your friend, you would do it over the phone or in person instead of incessantly typing away at your computer, wouldnt you? The next time you have the urge to go on g-chat to see what your 28th best friend is up to? Close your device and go for a walk instead."
How to Be Quiet: 17 Pro Tips,Take breaks from social media.,"Better yet, take a break from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and any other social media you may be using all too often. These sites are filled with noise, with people trying to impress each other, and with meaningless words that you may feel compelled to respond to. If youre really addicted, then spend just 10-15 minutes a day on all of your social media sites instead of spending your time checking them every chance you get.[7]Wouldnt you rather hear what your closest friends have to say in person instead of hearing what perfect strangers have to say to the world? Turn off all of the extra voices that you hear and focus only on the ones that matter."
How to Be Quiet: 17 Pro Tips,Write in a journal.,"Make a habit of writing in your journal at the end of every day or week. This can help you write down those extra thoughts, stay quiet, and feel like youve gotten everything off your chest without telling your fifteen best friends about it. You can just write about what happened during your day, which will lead you to ask more questions and to write about the deeper things on your mind.[8]Youll be amazed by how much quieter you may be if you write just one journal page each day."
How to Be Quiet: 17 Pro Tips,Meditate.,"Meditating is a great way to turn off your mind and to keep your body and being quiet. Take 10-20 minute every morning to find a comfortable seat in a quiet room, close your eyes, and focus on your breath rising and falling from your body. Focus on relaxing your body one part at a time and notice what you hear, smell, feel, and sense as youre sitting there. Banish any serious thoughts and focus just on being in the moment and appreciating the quiet, and youll be on your way to having a more centered, quiet day.[9]Meditating can keep you from feeling overwhelmed by giving you more control over your mind and body."
How to Be Quiet: 17 Pro Tips,Appreciate nature.,Take a walk. Go to the beach. Look at all of the beautiful plants in the garden on the other side of town. Take a weekend trip to the woods. Do what youve gotta do to get closer to nature. Youll be awed by the beauty and power of something so much more permanent than you are and youll feel all of your doubts and words melt away. Its hard to keep chatting on and on about what you think will be on the next math quiz when youre standing at the base of a beautiful mountain that has been in existence since the beginning of time.[10]Plug some nature time into your weekly routine. You can even bring your journal out to nature and write down your thoughts there.
How to Be Quiet: 17 Pro Tips,Turn off the music.,"Sure, music may make it more fun for you to study, to go running, or to commute to work. However, music can create extra noise that makes you feel a bit more chatty, frantic, and excitable. Classical music or jazz can be okay, but loud music with catchy lyrics can create noise that will bounce around in your head and keep you from feeling calm and in control of your day."
How to Be Quiet: 17 Pro Tips,Give it time.,"If youre a naturally loud, talkative person, then you wont be Ms. Quiet overnight. But if you make an effort to talk a little bit less each day, to pursue hobbies and activities that make you more quiet, and to focus on being a good listener instead of a good talker, youll be able to become more quiet sooner than you think.

4 Ways to Create a Realistic Fiction Character - wikiHow,Name your character,". A big identifier of your character will be their name. Think about people you know in real life who remind you of the character or who inspired the character. [1]You can also play on an existing name you feel fits with the character; try using a variation of the name or changing the spelling. For example, Kris or Chrissie instead of Chris, or Tara instead of Tanya.Be careful with making up names. Made up names may make your character less believable. Additionally, avoid making up names for character's from another (nonfictional) culture. It will likely be unrealistic and may offend.Look for names that fit with your character's background and don't seem odd in terms of your character's role or position. Try looking up historical name trends to find a name that fits your character's time period.There are several character name generators online that you can also use, filtering by background and gender."
4 Ways to Create a Realistic Fiction Character - wikiHow,"Note your character's gender, age, height, and weight.","If your character was to fill out a census or a form at a doctor's office, what would they specify? Though you may not use this character information in your story or novel, your character's gender, and age will affect their character voice and their point of view.[2][3]For example, the young child character, Scout, in Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird will view the world of the novel differently than her father, Atticus Finch, an older man.These don't have to be exact in most cases; ""young teen"" or ""mid-thirties"" will usually suffice."
4 Ways to Create a Realistic Fiction Character - wikiHow,Describe your character's appearance.,"It's important to specify your character's physical characteristics. Often, description of characters focuses on hair color or eye color, and these details can help signal to your reader that your character has a certain ethnic background or appearance. These descriptions can also indicate a certain type of character.For example, describing your character's physical appearance as: She had dishwater blonde hair and gray eyes that glazed over when she was bored not only gives your reader a clear physical description, it also shows the character's personality."
4 Ways to Create a Realistic Fiction Character - wikiHow,Create distinguishing markers or scars on your character.,"Harry Potter's lightning bolt scar is a good example of a distinguishing marker that identifies his character and makes him unique. You can also use birthmarks, like a mole on your character's face, or a marker due to an accident, like a burn mark or a scar due to stitches. These scars or markers can make your character feel distinct to your reader. They can also tell the reader more about your character.In To Kill a Mockingbird, Scout's brother Jem is characterized on the first page of the novel through a description of his broken arm: When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow. When it healed, and Jem's fears of never being able to play football were assuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury. His left arm was somewhat shorter than his right; when he stood or walked, the back of his hand was at right angles to his body, his thumb parallel to his thigh. He couldn't have cared less, so long as he could pass and punt.Harper Lee uses the injury, or physical marker, to introduce Jem's character and tell the reader that he has a shorter left arm, a distinguishing characteristic that makes him a more nuanced and believable character."
4 Ways to Create a Realistic Fiction Character - wikiHow,Note your character's fashion sense.,"Clothing can be a great way to show the reader more of your character's personality and preferences. A character who wears punk t-shirts, black jeans, and Doc Martens will come across as a rebellious character, while a character who wears a sweater set and loafers may come across as a more conservative character.Be specific when you are describing a character's clothing, but don't repeat descriptions too much in the narrative. Establishing your character's style of dress once will create a clear picture in the reader's mind that they can refer back to.In Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep, the main character Philip Marlowe describes his clothing in two concise sentences: I was wearing my powder-blue suit, with dark blue shirt, tie and display handkerchief, black brogues, black wool socks with dark blue clocks on them. I was neat, clean, shaved and sober, and I didn't care who knew it.Chandler uses very specific detail to paint a clear image of Marlowe and he injects the description with Marlowe's voice, I didn't care who knew it, adding more depth to the description."
4 Ways to Create a Realistic Fiction Character - wikiHow,Determine your character's background and class.,"Your character's station in life will affect how she navigates certain situations and how she will react to everyday occurrences. A young African American man living in Washington, D.C. will have a different experience or perspective than a young Southern man living in Little Rock, Arkansas. A middle class woman living in New York will have different daily experience than a woman living on food stamps in New York. Your character's background and class experience will be an integral part of their perspective as a character.Though it is not essential that you announce your character's background and class to the reader, your character will feel more realistic and true if their station in life factors into their point of view. The characters in the fiction of Junot Diaz, for example, use colloquial terms that indicate class and background to the reader.In Diaz's short story The Cheater's Guide to Love he notes: Maybe if you'd been engaged to a super-open-minded blanquita you could have survived itbut you're not engaged to a super-open-minded blanquita. Your girl is a bad-ass salcedense who doesn't believe in open anything; in fact, the one thing she warned you about, that she swore she would never forgive, was cheating.[4]In this story, Diaz uses Spanish terms to indicate the character/narrator's background, without having to tell the reader directly that the narrator is Spanish."
4 Ways to Create a Realistic Fiction Character - wikiHow,Conduct research on your character's profession or career.,"Another way to make your character more believable on the page is to delve into the details of their profession or career. If you are writing a character who works as an architect, this character should know about how to design a building and may see a city skyline in a unique way. Or if you are writing a character who works as a private detective, this character should know basic P.I. protocol and how to solve a case. Use library books and online sources to make your character's career convincing in your story.If possible, try to speak to someone who is in the profession of your character. Interview them about their daily habits at work to make sure you are getting the details of their profession right. They may even be willing to give feedback on your writing."
4 Ways to Create a Realistic Fiction Character - wikiHow,Give your character a purpose or desire.,"One of the most distinguishing aspects of your character should be their purpose or want in the story. Your character's goals should drive the story and their goal should be unique to their character. For example, your character might be a young African American man who is trying to get into the NBA. Or your character might be an old woman who is trying to reconnect with her long lost son. Making your character's purpose or goal specific will help them seem more realistic and believable.[5]Another key aspect of your character's goal is that your character should have a small goal, such as trying to get a girl, and a large goal, such as confirming love is real. Try to give your character small and a large goals so their story feels specific and also general, or universal, to your reader."
4 Ways to Create a Realistic Fiction Character - wikiHow,Consider your character's strengths and weaknesses.,"A hero with no flaws or a villain with no heart will be flat characters on the page. Give your character strengths and weaknesses to create a well rounded character who is also relatable to your reader. The protagonist's weaknesses should be out weighed just slightly by your character's strengths, especially if they are going to be the underdog or underachiever in your story.[6]For example, your character may be shy, but has a good mind for solving riddles and puzzles. Or your character may struggle with anger or rage, but tries to maintain control over their emotions.Balancing your character's strengths with weaknesses (and vice versa) will make your character more endearing and relatable to your reader, which will then make the character feel more realistic.Overly perfect characters who unrealistically lack flaws are called ""Mary Sues""."
4 Ways to Create a Realistic Fiction Character - wikiHow,Give your character a backstory.,"Not all characters have to be motivated by a past trauma or fear, but creating a backstory for your character with events which may have harmed or damaged them can create tension in the character's present life. A backstory is events or moments in the character's life that happens before the story begins.[7]A backstory can also allow you to make the character more believable on the page. A character who refers to previous events will widen the scope of the story and give the character a more well developed presence in the story.For example, in Diaz's short story The Cheater's Guide to Love, the reader is told of backstory, the narrator's past transgressions while he was with his girlfriend. This backstory becomes the reason why the narrator's girlfriend leaves him. So the backstory is doing two things in the story: it is showing the reader more about the narrator and it is a major plot point in the story. It also widens the scope of the story, as the reader is dropped into the narrator's immediate drama (the girlfriend leaving him) but this drama stems from past events that the narrator must face in the present."
4 Ways to Create a Realistic Fiction Character - wikiHow,Create a nemesis for your character.,"Another way to create a more realistic character in your story is to create a person or force that is working against your character. A nemesis will add an element of reality to the story, as in real life, we are often faced with opposing forces or challenging individuals.[8]The nemesis could be in the form of a nosy neighbor, an annoying family member, or a troublesome partner. Your character's nemesis should correspond with the character's purpose or desire.For example, a character who is trying to land a basketball scholarship may have a nemesis in the form of a rival teammate, or an overbearing coach. A character who is trying to win back a girl he cheated on may have a nemesis in the form of his inability to control his own desires or be monogamous."
4 Ways to Create a Realistic Fiction Character - wikiHow,Don't be afraid to use colloquial terms in dialogue.,"Colloquialisms are informal words, phrases or slang.[9] Your characters should sound as unique as the individuals you encounter every day, and that includes any slang or informal terms they might use. For example, two teenage boys likely will not greet each other with: Good day, sir. Instead, they may say What's up? or What's goin' on?Be careful about using too many colloquial terms in your dialogue. It can begin to feel distracting or gimmicky if it is overused. Strive for a balance between proper English terms and slang or colloquialisms."
4 Ways to Create a Realistic Fiction Character - wikiHow,Think about code switching.,"Code switching is a language shift made by a character in response to who they are speaking to. It occurs often in everyday life, especially for individuals from different backgrounds or classes who are trying to assimilate or blend in.If you are writing a character from a certain background, setting, or class, you should consider how they will might use local slang in their dialogue and description depending on who they are speaking to in a scene. A Jamaican man speaking to another Jamaican man, for example, will likely use patois and slang like Yah, mon or Stay ire. But the same Jamaican man speaking to a white police officer may use more formal speech like Yes, sir or Stay cool."
4 Ways to Create a Realistic Fiction Character - wikiHow,Use dialogue tags.,"Dialogue tags, or speech tags, are like signposts. They attribute written dialogue to characters. Some of the more commonly used dialogue tags are said , ""asked"" and told. Dialogue tags don't need to be fancy or overly descriptive. Their primary purpose are to show which characters speak and when. But you can also build believable characters through dialogue tags.[10]Each tag should contain at least one noun or pronoun (Scout, she, Jem, he, you, they, we, the man, etc.) and a verb indicating how the dialogue is being spoken (said, asked, whispered, remarked). For example, Scout said to Jem or Jem whispered to ScoutYou can add adjectives and adverbs to tags to provide more information about the speaker. For example, Scout said quietly to Jem or Jem whispered harshly to Scout. Adding an adverb can be a quick and useful way to indicate a certain mannerism or emotion in a character. But be wary of overusing adjectives and adverbs in your dialogue tags. Try to only use one adjective or adverb per scene for one character's dialogue tag."
4 Ways to Create a Realistic Fiction Character - wikiHow,Read the dialogue out loud.,"Your character's dialogue should feel unique to their character and representative of how they interact with others. Good dialogue in fiction should be doing more than simply telling the reader how a character gets from A to B, or how the character knows another character. Read the character's dialogue out loud to ensure it sounds like speech a person might say to another person in the scene. The dialogue should also sounds true to the character.For example, in To Kill a Mockingbird, Lee uses dialogue to distinguish the characters in a scene. She also uses colloquial terms that represent children living in a small Southern town in the 1950s.Hey. Hey yourself, said Jem pleasantly. I'm Charles Baker Harris, he said. I can read. So what? I said.I just thought you'd like to know I can read. You got anything needs readin' I can do itHow old are you, asked Jem, four-and-a-half? Goin' on seven. Shoot no wonder, then, said Jem, jerking his thumb at me. Scout yonder's been readin' ever since she was born, and she ain't even started to school yet. You look right puny for goin' on seven.Lee makes Jem's dialogue distinct from Charles Baker Harris' dialogue and Scout's dialogue by using slang terms and colloquialisms. This establishes Jem as a character and creates a dynamic between all three speakers in the scene."

How to Check Air Pressure in Tires: 9 Steps (with Pictures),Look in the owners' manual or on the inside of the driver's side door for the standard cold tire inflation pressure.,"This number is the lowest PSI one would inflate the tires to and is suggested by the car's manufacturer.[1] Read below for reasons inflation may be placed higher.For most sedans, minivans, and even mini pickups, manufacturers generally recommend a PSI (pounds per square inch) in the range of 27 to 32, but can reach all the way up to 40.[2]For larger vehicles that need to carry a larger burden, such as trucks and SUVs, the PSI is generally 4 to 8 PSI greater than it would be in smaller cars, perhaps around 45.Also note that the front and back tires may need different pressures, according to the manufacturer."
How to Check Air Pressure in Tires: 9 Steps (with Pictures),Unscrew the valve stem cap from the valve stem on the tire.,"The valve stem is a black or silver pencil-sized extension near the hubcap, about 1"" (2-3 cm) long."

The angle of the gauge may need to be adjusted.If you are using a digital model gauge, you may or may not need to press a button in order for the gauge to read the air pressure. If you are using a traditional gauge, the metered stick should give you a reading automatically."
How to Check Air Pressure in Tires: 9 Steps (with Pictures),Replace valve stem cap.,"The cap does not hold air in, but it keeps dirt and moisture away from the valve mechanism in the valve stem, which does hold air in.Note that if the reading is the same as the manuals' specifications, you are done after checking all other tires for the same pressure. If inadequate pressure is in the tires then fill air in the tires. Make sure you put in the correct amount."
How to Check Air Pressure in Tires: 9 Steps (with Pictures),Know that the manufacturer's PSI recommendations don't translate into optimum tire performance.,"For all-around driving, the manufacturer's specifications are probably ideal, but adding a couple extra pounds of pressure into your tires may mean better fuel efficiency. Overall, adding a few pounds of PSI to your tires may make your ride a bit bumpier and less pleasant, so use with tact!An increase in PSI can also result in uneven tire wear, longer required braking distances, and reduced handling. Make sure you don't over-inflate your tires."
How to Check Air Pressure in Tires: 9 Steps (with Pictures),Understand the myth about the max press value in the owner's manual or driver's side door.,"One popular misconception is that the max pressure suggested by the manufacturer is all the pressure the tire can handle before it pops or malfunctions. In truth, the max pressure is the pressure at which the tires will carry the maximum amount of weight.[3]As soon as you inflate the tires past the max pressure limit, be prepared for the possibility of malfunction. If your tires are bearing heavier air pressure, a pothole at high speeds could spell disaster."
How to Check Air Pressure in Tires: 9 Steps (with Pictures),"Add a few extra pounds of pressure to the back tires if you're carrying extra cargo, carpooling, etc.","If you happen to be carrying a heavier load in your car, especially if you are traveling for longer distances, don't be afraid to add a few pounds of PSI to your rear tires to offset the added weight.

How to Check Air Pressure in Tires: 9 Steps (with Pictures),Never rely on the eyeball method to gauge air pressure in tires.,"Don't get lazy. It's very difficult to tell the difference between a tire with 10 PSI and 20 PSI. Plus, tires normally exhibit a bit of a bulge on the sidewall of radial tires.

18 Psychological Signs a Girl Likes You,Holding a gaze indicates a desire to deepen the connection with you.,"Mutual eye contact can make for an incredibly intimate momentthat's why people don't tend to do it except with people they're interested in romantically or sexually. If she's making direct eye contact with you for a second longer than normal, you can tell she's thinking about you as more than just a friend.[2]Prolonged eye contact can also trigger the body's release of oxytocin, known as ""the love hormone"" for the way it makes you feel.[3]Keep in mind that eye contact is difficult for some people, so don't assume she's not into you just because she doesn't make eye contact very often.Reader Poll: We asked 1039 wikiHow readers to tell us what the clearest indicator was that a girl liked them, and 50% said prolonged eye contact.

18 Psychological Signs a Girl Likes You,Mirroring is a subconscious signal that she likes you.,"While mirroring can be used consciously to establish rapport, it's usually not a voluntary thing.

18 Psychological Signs a Girl Likes You,Leaning in and angling toward you signal that she's focused on you.,"This is basic body language that's often something she does subconsciously.

18 Psychological Signs a Girl Likes You,Using your name shows that she recognizes and respects you.,"Calling you by name is a bit like touching you.

That shows self-awareness, and that's really important to me.""Women with a more traditional flirting style, on the other hand, might not compliment you as much. It's her style that matters!

18 Psychological Signs a Girl Likes You,"If she likes you, she'll have increased attention toward you.","She'll be genuinely interested in what you like and what you don't, and she'll make an effort to remember these things. She might surprise you later by mentioning something she knows you like that you forgot you told her because she's more prone to remembering things about you.[12]"

No version of the punk way of life caters to the norm or caves into the mainstream. If it's not trendy, it's good. If it makes your mom furrow her brow, it's good. If the cool kids wouldn't be caught dead wearing it, it's good."

How to Dress Punk: 12 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Hone your DIY skills.,"[3] Core to the punk image is being anti-brand. Anti big stores, anti-capitalism. And the easiest way to stick it to the man? Do the job yourself. Rip your jeans, take a black marker to your t-shirt, turn wire into jewelry, whatever. If it's made by you, you can make sure no one else has it.If you're lacking in creativity skills, there are still tons of ways to show your own style. Add patches to wherever, get experimental with dyes, and go to town with a pair of scissors. It doesn't have to look good. That's actually the idea. The more not-good it looks, the better. Who knew not being creative would ever come in handy?"

How to Dress Punk: 12 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Don't shy away from metal and other textures.,"There is nothing wrong with rocking a pair of chinos with a mesh top and a leather jacket.

This means viewing God as a Heavenly Father and not as an impersonal deity.[1]Your relationship with God should be based on love and not on the blind obedience of rules.Think about family relationships among humans, focusing primarily on the relationship between parent and child. Even someone who has had issues with a human parent can usually understand what healthy parental love looks like.

Those who are in the realm of the flesh cannot please God.""Walking in the Spirit does not mean that you will never sin again, of course. You will face temptation and stumble from time to time.

Some people say this once, others say this twice. This depends on the school of jurisprudence (madhab) followed. Saying it twice is sunnah according to a saheeh hadith.[14]"

How to Develop Your Sixth Sense: 10 Steps (with Pictures),Learn to notice small things.,"Part of developing a sixth sense is learning how to pay close attention to your surroundings, particularly to small or minute details.The more attention you pay to your surroundings, the more aware you become of slight changes and variations, and the more attuned you become with the world around you.[10]Enhancing your perception this way helps you to notice subtle shifts and changes in your environment and eventually to anticipate certain things before they happen.For example, imagine a street you travel frequently. Try to imagine it in as close and as much precise detail as you can. Where are the various shops located? Which traffic signs are posted? What are the parking regulations? What kind of landscaping does the street have? Write down as many details as youre able to remember, then go visit that street and carefully fill in the blanks in your memory. Write down a detailed description of what you see. Later, test yourself to see how accurately you remembered the details you wrote down. Learn to notice and absorb this level of detail wherever you go."
How to Develop Your Sixth Sense: 10 Steps (with Pictures),Record what you see.,"Teach yourself to focus your attention outward rather than inward. Doing so will help you develop sensitivity to what goes on around you and will teach you to quiet your own thoughts and preoccupations when necessary.Take a notebook with you when you go places. Note what you see and sense in as much detail as possible. Make this a regular practice until you find yourself doing it automatically, with or without the notebook."
How to Develop Your Sixth Sense: 10 Steps (with Pictures),Learn to watch and listen closely.,"When talking with someone, train yourself to put your full attention on them. When you learn to observe someone closely and attentively, you often learn to pick up on small, nearly imperceptible cues that will indicate what the person is truly feeling or thinking.Note small variations in their tone and inflection, watch the movement of their eyes and the contraction or dilation of their pupils, pay attention to the words they choose, and notice the pauses and silences between their words."
How to Develop Your Sixth Sense: 10 Steps (with Pictures),Exercise your non-visual senses.,"We tend to rely on our sight to interpret the world around us, so much so that sight can come to predominate over our other senses. But if you consciously work on prioritizing senses other than sight, you can begin to perceive more subtle variations in the environment of which you were previously unaware.Try closing your eyes and using your other senses to perceive people as they walk by. Note the sound of their clothing, footfalls, and breathing. Note their smell. Note the subtle changes in the air around them as they move. Note any temperature changes that occur as they pass. See if you can detect where their attention is directed and if you can tell when their attention falls on you.As you become more sensitive to people and the energy they give off, see if you can notice the particular type of energy of each person who passes. Can you pick up on any tension or on any negative or positive energy?Try to assess the energy of rooms you walk into. Can you sense any positive or negative energy?"

How to Learn Dutch (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Understand how the Dutch language developed.,"Dutch is classified as a West Germanic language which is closely related to other languages in this branch, including German, English and West Frisian.[1]The Dutch language originally developed from the Lower Franconian dialect of Low German. However modern Dutch has departed from its German origins in that it did not undergo the High German consonant shift and does not use the German umlaut as a grammatical marker.In addition, Dutch has more or less abandoned its original grammatical case system and has leveled a lot of its morphology. [2]On the other hand, Dutch vocabulary is primarily Germanic in origin (although it contains more Romance loan words) and uses the same word order in sentences (SVO in main clauses and SOV in subordinate clauses).[3]"
How to Learn Dutch (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Know where Dutch is spoken.,"Dutch is spoken as a first language by approximately 20 million people, mostly in the Netherlands and Belgium. It is spoken as a second language by approximately another 5 million.[4]In addition to The Netherlands and Belgium, Dutch is also used in parts of Northern France, Germany, Suriname and Indonesia and is an official language on the Caribbean islands of The Netherland Antilles.The dialects of Dutch spoken in Belgium are known collectively as Flemish. Flemish differs from standard Dutch in several ways, including pronunciation, vocabulary and intonation.The language of Afrikaans -- which is spoken in South Africa and Namibia by approximately 10 million people -- is a descendant of Dutch and the two languages are considered mutually intelligible.[5]"
How to Learn Dutch (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Start with the alphabet and pronunciation.,"When beginning to learn any language, the alphabet is a good place to start.[6]A (ah) B (bay) C (say) D (day) E (ay) F (eff) G (khay) H (hah) I (ee) J (yay) K (kah) L (ell) M (emm) N (enn) O (oh) P (pay) Q (kew) R (air) S (ess) T (tay) U (ew) V (vay) W (way) X (eeks) Y (ee-grek or 'I') Z (zed).However, in terms of actual pronunciation, Dutch contains many sounds which are not used in English and can therefore be difficult to learn. The only letters which have the same pronunciation in Dutch as in English are the consonants s, f, h, b, d, z, l, m, n,  ng. The letters p, t, and k are formed in the same way, but they are not aspirated (there is no puff of air when they are spoken).The best way to learn the pronunciation of some of the more unusual consonant and vowel sounds is to listen to them and repeat. The following overview is not exhaustive, but it will help you to get started:Vowels: a (pronounced like ""ah"" in ""calm"", but shorter), e (pronounced like ""eh"" in ""bed""),  i (pronounced like ""ih"" in ""bit""), o (pronounced like ""aw"" in ""paw"", but with rounded lips), oe (pronounced like the ""oo"" in ""too"" but shorter), u (pronounced like the ""u"" in ""upset"", or ""ir"" in ""dirt"") and y (pronounced like the ""i"" in ""pin"" or ""ee"" in ""deep"", but shorter).Consonants: Some consonant sounds that are pronounced very differently in Dutch are ch, sch and g which all produce a guttural sound in the back of the throat (almost like the ""ch"" in the Scottish word ""loch""). The Dutch r can be rolled or guttural, while the j is pronounced like the ""y"" in ""yes"". [7]"
How to Learn Dutch (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Understand Dutch noun genders.,"The Dutch language classifies all of its nouns into one of two genders -- common (de words) or neuter (het words). This is much less complicated than German , which has three.[8]It can be difficult to guess which gender a word is based on how it looks. Therefore, it's better to just memorize the gender of specific words as you learn them.The common gender is actually a combined form of the masculine and feminine genders, which are no longer used. As a result, about 2/3 of all nouns belong to the common gender.Therefore, a good technique is just to learn all of the neuter nouns. Then you can be confident that any of the nouns you haven't learned are most likely common.You can identify neuter nouns by learning a number of rules. For example, all diminutive nouns (which end in je) and all infinitives that are used as nouns are neuter. This is also true for words that end in -um, -aat, -sel and -isme, and for most words that start with ge-, be- and ver-. The words for colors, compass directions and metals are also always neuter."

In England, you will have to join the Join Industry Stunt Committee's Stunt Register (JISC); look into the guilds in your country if these do not apply to you.Getting into a guild is hard work. One way you can get in, if you're lucky, is to get waved in in case a stunt coordinator isn't able to find a person with the combination of skills and build that you have to do a certain job (for example, if you're four foot five and can climb a mountain).Another way of getting in is to try to get work on a SAG or other union film as an extra for at least three separate days.

If you're tired of being a stunt man or a stunt driver but you've gained a lot of experience, then you don't have to quit your field completely; instead, you can find a way to take a more management-related role while still staying in the stunt world. Here are some other roles you can take on:Stunt rigger: To be a stunt rigger, you should not only be an experienced stunt performer, but you should have an understanding of the mechanics of stunt equipment. You should have safety as your first priority, and will perform a variety of tasks, from testing and tearing down stunt equipment on the set to arranging landing pads for falls and positioning wires and harnesses correctly.Stunt coordinator: This is the head of the stunt department, the person who works closely with the director to create the action sequences in the film, or even to suggest alternative stunt scenarios when it is necessary. The stunt coordinator designs the desired stunts, hires the stunt crew, manages the budget, and makes sure all of the stunts are performed safely.Second unit director: The person in charge of filming the stunt scenes, as opposed to the stunt coordinator, who is responsible for staging the actual stunts. As the second unit director, you will film scenes of the stunt performers in action as well as exterior shots of the scenes which can be used in post-production. Although these directors may have experience in stunt work, then must also be experienced in filming and directing."

Why? So you can get hired again.When you're following directions, it's important to be polite and reasonable when you interact with the crew.

How to Be a Stunt Man: 15 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Be prepared for long hours.,"Being a stunt person doesn't mean falling out of a helicopter for three takes and then calling it a day. It can mean over 14 hours on a set, working nights, and staying mentally and physically alert throughout the process. This is a full-time job, and once you start landing enough gigs, you must be able to commit to the time that you'll need to succeed in your role. In the beginning, you may be juggling other work along with stunt work, but if you've hit the big leagues, you must be ready to give it your all.[4]This means that you'll need endurance to succeed at the job.

You'll be traveling to the Caribbean to film a jet-skiing sequence. You might find yourself in Peru to shoot a rock climbing scene. You might even be in Germany for a high-speed car chase. This means long hours on airplanes, and needing to get over jet lag before you hit those jet-skiis. Sure, this will be exciting, thrilling work, but you'll need to be prepared for all of the travel it involves.[5]As you get older, all of the traveling may become more difficult because you'll have to find a way to make time for your family, if you have one."
How to Be a Stunt Man: 15 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Stay physically strong.,"Most stunt men are at the peak of their careers between their 20s and 40s, which means that you have to stay in the best possible shape during these years. This means not engaging in risky behavior, whether you're on the job or hanging out with friends, and avoiding overindulgence in food or drink, which can wear down your body and make you feel horrible when you show up to work. Eat healthy, get enough rest, and make sure to exercise as often as you can, doing a mixture of cardiovascular and strength training, so you're fit enough to do the job.[6]Another way to stay strong is to continue to brush up on your skills, whether you're practicing karate or swimming.If you want to stay physically strong, then you have to keep your mind strong, too. You can't let the dangers of the job get to you and you have to stay focused and positive if you want to succeed in the long run."
How to Be a Stunt Man: 15 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Be a master at risk management.,"Being a stunt man doesn't mean recklessly jumping out of three story windows, playing with fire, or crashing a motorcycle into a tree because you weren't careful. Stunt men have families, drive, and exciting careers, which means that they love what they do and want to stay alive to continue doing it. When you get training on how to fall without hurting yourself, drive without crashing, and swim without drowning, etc, you should heed those words carefully, and not go out of bounds to show off if it means risking your life.[7]A study conducted by the University of Illinois at Chicago showed that there were 37 fatalities on film or TV sets between 1980-1989 by stunt men and women alone; a study by the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) showed that 4,998 of its members were injured between the years of 1982-1986, mostly because of stunts.

How to Set up a Wireless Network (WiFi) Connection,Acquire a wireless router.,"Most ISPs include router and modem rentals with their internet packages, so you don't have to worry about getting the correct equipment! There are a variety of factors that will determine which router is best for you. These include distance, interference, transfer speed, and security.One of the most important factors to consider when purchasing a router is the distance between the router and the devices that you are wirelessly connecting. More expensive routers generally have more antennae, which can lead to a more stable connection at further distances.Another factor to consider is the amount of signal interference. If you have multiple devices that operate on the 2.4 GHz band, such as microwaves and cordless phones, these can interfere with the Wi-Fi signal. Newer routers can operate on the 5 GHz band, which is much less crowded and thus less prone to interference. The drawback is that 5 GHz signals do not travel as far as 2.4 GHz signals.. If you're purchasing a separate router and modem, transfer speed is a feature to consider. Newer routers claim to be able to transfer data up to 450 Mbps. While this may be helpful when moving data between two computers over a network, it will not increase your general Internet speed, as this is set by your ISP. There are three main router speeds available: 802.11g (54 Mbps) 802.11n (300 Mbps), and 802.11ac (450 Mbps). It is important to note that these speeds are virtually impossible to attain in any environment other than a clean room free of signal interference.Finally, make sure that the router you are purchasing has the latest form of wireless encryption, WPA2. This is pretty much standard in all new routers but is something to consider if purchasing an older, second-hand router. Older encryption algorithms are much less secure; a WEP key can be cracked in just a few minutes."
How to Set up a Wireless Network (WiFi) Connection,Connect the router to your modem.,"Many ISPs will hand out router/modem combined units, so you don't need to worry about many of these steps involving separate units. Once you've purchased your router, you will need to connect it to your modem. The router will have a port in the back labeled WAN/WLAN/Internet. Connect this port to the modem using a standard Ethernet cable.Make sure that the router is properly powered and turned on."
How to Set up a Wireless Network (WiFi) Connection,Connect a computer via an ethernet cable.,"This step is not always necessary but can be very useful if you want to set up the wireless router before connecting any wireless devices to it. Connecting a computer through a physical cable will allow you to tinker with the wireless settings without losing your connection to the router.For optimum efficiency while setting up the router, plug it in next to your computer while you adjust the settings. After you are finished configuring the router, you can move it to where it will normally stay.[1]"
How to Set up a Wireless Network (WiFi) Connection,Open the router's configuration page.,"If your router did not come with any installation software, you will need to connect to the router's configuration page through your web browser.

How to Set up a Wireless Network (WiFi) Connection,Set your wireless settings.,"Most routers will have a Wireless Settings section towards the top of the router's menu. From this section, you can enable or disable the wireless signal, change the network name, and set the encryption.To set the name of the network, select the SSID field. This is the name that will be displayed on any device that detects your network. If you are living in an area with a lot of public traffic, avoid putting any identifiable information in the SSID, as anyone with a wireless device can see it.Make sure to set the encryption to the latest version allowed by your router. In most cases, this will be WPA2. WPA2 operates with a single password. You can enter whatever you'd like, but a strong password is recommended. Stronger passwords contain upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols."
How to Set up a Wireless Network (WiFi) Connection,Apply your settings.,"Make sure you click the Apply or Save Changes button in your router's configuration when you are done changing the settings. The router will process for a moment, and your new settings will take effect."
How to Set up a Wireless Network (WiFi) Connection,Place your router.,"In order to get the best possible signal, try to place your router in a central location. Keep in mind that any obstacles such as walls and doors will degrade the signal. If you have multiple floors, you may want to consider multiple routers to ensure that you have the coverage you need.Remember that it must be physically connected to your modem, so this may limit your options when placing the router."
How to Set up a Wireless Network (WiFi) Connection,Connect your device to Wi-Fi.,"Once the router is broadcasting a wireless signal, you can test the connection by scanning for wireless networks.On an Android, swipe down from the top of your screen and tap and hold the Wi-Fi icon, which will open your Wi-Fi settings.

If the metal is still grimy, scrub it with soapy water, then dry.If the metal is coated with a protective finish, which is often the case for brass, you do not need to remove it. However, the engraving process will cut through this finish, so you'll need to apply a new finish afterward if you want the metal color to remain consistent."
3 Ways to Engrave - wikiHow,Draw or print a design.,"If you are working on a small object, or engraving for the first time, draw or print out a design that has simple, well-spaced lines. Finicky, detailed work is difficult to do without practice, and may end up looking muddled or blurry once engraved. You may be able to draw the design directly on to the metal. If not, draw or print it out at the correct size, then follow the next step to transfer it onto the metal.If engraving letters, make them as even as possible by drawing them between two straight, parallel lines drawn with a ruler.[2]"
3 Ways to Engrave - wikiHow,Transfer the design onto the metal (if necessary).,"Follow this step if you want to transfer a design onto the metal; if it is already on the metal, move on to the next step instead.

Note that most of these also require some type of specialized equipment.Add a varnish or shellac to the area you want engraved, waiting until it is mostly dry and slightly tacky.Draw the design onto polyester film (Mylar) using a soft lead pencil.Cover the drawing with scotch tape. Rub the tape thoroughly with your fingernail or a burnisher, then carefully lift up the tape. The design is now on the tape.Stick the tape over the varnished metal. Rub it in with your fingernail in the same way, then remove it.[3]"
3 Ways to Engrave - wikiHow,Clamp your metal in place.,"Engraving will be much easier if you use a clamp or vise to prevent the metal from slipping. You may use a handheld clamp that allows you to hold it in one hand with a steadier grip, but be aware that this increases the chance of cuts or scrapes. If you are using a powered tool, or a hammer and chisel that requires two hands, a clamp holding the metal to a table or other stable surface is highly recommended."
3 Ways to Engrave - wikiHow,Cut into the design.,"Use your chosen tool to turn the drawing into an engraving, putting pressure on the point at an angle to chip away pieces of metal. For your first attempts, try to keep the end of your tool at the same angle throughout the engraving. Begin by working a straight line in both directions until it is a noticeable, deep cut. Use this as a starting point to move on to the remaining lines. To engrave a line with a complex shape, such as a J, finish the straight portion first. Once this is complete, move on to the more difficult non-carved section.[4]"

This can take some practice to use correctly, but it is an excellent skill to develop for wood engraving."
3 Ways to Engrave - wikiHow,Experiment with your approach.,"One way to start a woodcut is to cut the outline of the image first, making it slightly too large so you can refine the details with a smaller tool.[13] There are many stylized forms of shading, but a series of small, mostly parallel lines in an overlapping ""falling rain"" pattern often creates the most natural effect.[14]"

Purchase a tube of oil-based black relief printing ink for this purpose. Squeeze a tiny amount onto the flat, curved portion of the wood, and use a hand roller, or ""brayer,"" to spread a fine layer over the entire surface. Add more ink if necessary, and keep rolling with even pressure until the surface is smooth.[15]"
3 Ways to Engrave - wikiHow,Transfer your design onto paper.,"Lay a sheet of paper over the wet block, taking care not to move it once it comes into contact with the ink. Rub over the back of the paper using a burnisher tool, or any smooth, flat object. Lift the paper once it has been rubbed, and you should have a print of your image. Repeat this as many times as necessary, rolling out additional ink whenever the block dries out.If the burnisher is not sliding easily, rubbing it against your hair may provide just enough oil to help, without staining the paper.[16]Look for a ""burnisher printing tool,"" since there are tools used in other professions also called burnishers."
3 Ways to Engrave - wikiHow,Clean your tools.,"After a printing session, wipe away ink from the woodcut and tools using mineral spirits (white spirit) or vegetable oil and a clean rag.[17] Store your woodcut for later use, if you plan to print it again."
How to Flutter Kick: Improve Your Swimming & Freestyle,Place your hands against a pool wall to hold yourself steady.,"Push your feet off the ground and extend your legs behind you so youre nearly floating (your feet will want to keep sinking down). Hold your arms out straight so youre as horizontal as possible in the water.[1]Have children or people who don't want to be underwater hold their head above water (or put their arms on top of the wall so their head and arms are dry).As you get more comfortable with this position, practice lowering your face into the water. Your body will float easier and stay aligned when your head is down.Try a snorkeling mask in the beginning so you can keep your head down. Later, ditch the mask and lift your head above water when you need to breathe."
How to Flutter Kick: Improve Your Swimming & Freestyle,Use your hip muscles to push one leg down in the water.,"Begin your kick cycle with your dominant leg. Keep your entire leg fairly straight and relaxed through the knee and ankle joints without bending your knee very much (this helps you stay streamlined).[2]Keep your toes pointed and turned slightly inward.Feel the power of the kick move from your hip, through your knee, and finish in your foot. Your foot moving down through the water creates propulsion."
How to Flutter Kick: Improve Your Swimming & Freestyle,Repeat with the other leg while you lift your first leg back up.,"In the beginning, let your first leg float back up on its ownas you master the kick, keep your hip muscles engaged to raise your leg and balance your kick strokes.[3] Remember to power your kick from the hips and push the water backward with pointed toes.[4]Keep your kicks fairly small. Its OK if your heels break the surface of the water, but keep the majority of your kick in line with your body.To develop your upbeat (raising your leg during a kick cycle), position yourself vertically in the water and kick back and forth rather than up and down."
How to Flutter Kick: Improve Your Swimming & Freestyle,Continue alternating legs to flutter kick.,"Maintain alternating beatsas one leg goes down, the other comes up. Increase the speed as the motions become more comfortable. When you flutter kick quickly, the force will drive your legs and hips upwards so theyre horizontally aligned with your body.[5]If your legs keep sinking, push your chest slightly further down in the water to balance your body alignment.If your legs are rising too much, keep your chest slightly higher in the water or try kicking with lower speed and power.Hold the wall until you can maintain a balanced, horizontal body position while kicking and barely touching the wall. Then its time to get moving!"
How to Flutter Kick: Improve Your Swimming & Freestyle,Hold on to a kick board,"to support yourself while kicking. Instead of a wall, grab a kick board by the short edge and hold it at arms length in front of you. Push off of the pool floor to elongate your body horizontally, then start flutter kicking like before. If youre using proper form, youll start moving forward.[6]Try to keep your head down (and come up to breathe) or use a snorkeling mask to keep your full body aligned.Notice how the kick propels you forward and holds your legs up.Avoid using a kickboard for someone younger than 6 years old since it may not teach proper swimming technique.[7]"
How to Flutter Kick: Improve Your Swimming & Freestyle,Push off from a pool wall to practice gliding and body alignment.,"At the surface or under the water, place your feet against a wall and straighten your legs to push off. Extend your arms in front of you (one hand over the other, like a torpedo), elongate your body into a horizontal line, and point your toes.[8]Glide through the water and begin flutter kicking as soon as you feel yourself losing momentum.Kick fast enough to keep your body horizontal. Most of your speed will come from adding arms (kicking powers about 15% of your speed).For practice, try gliding a few times without adding the kick to get used to the feeling of your body cutting through the water."
How to Flutter Kick: Improve Your Swimming & Freestyle,Practice timing your kicks with arm strokes.,"Push downward with the leg opposite from the arm thats starting your stroke cycle (for example, extend your right arm forward, over your head, and bring it down through the water while your left leg begins kicking), and repeat on the opposite side.[9]Theres no rule on how many kicks per stroke you need, but the most common ratios are the 2-, 4-, and 6-beat kicks:[10]2-beat kick: Kick each leg once per stroke cycle (a cycle means both arms have completed a stroke).4-beat kick: Kick each leg twice per cycle (in other words, each leg kicks once for each arm stroke).6-beat kick: Kick each leg 3 times per cycle. Kick right-left-right while your left arm strokes, then left-right-left while your right arm strokes."
How to Flutter Kick: Improve Your Swimming & Freestyle,Freestyle stroke,"To swim freestyle (front crawl), flutter kick and make sweeping windmill motions with your arms. Reach each arm forward and bring it into the water fingertips-first, just wider than your shoulders. Bend at the elbow and scoop the water behind you to propel forward.[11]Picture your forearm and hand like a giant paddle. This is called an early vertical forearm (EVF).Keep your elbows high as your hand exits the water. As a rule of thumb, keep your elbows higher than your hands both above and below the water.Notice how the flutter kick stabilizes your body position and supports the movement of your arms."
How to Flutter Kick: Improve Your Swimming & Freestyle,Backstroke,"To do a backstroke, float on your back and elongate your body into a straight line. Flutter kick like normal, except now youre pushing up on the water instead of down. Use your shoulders to lift each arm out of the water thumb-first and rotate them backward, similar to a freestyle stroke.[12]Keep your arm straight and enter the water pinky-first with your palm facing outward. Rotate your palm down and use it to scoop or push the water back.As your arm comes up, rotate your palm inward before it breaks the surface of the water for the next stroke.Keep your form the same as usualdrive the kick from your hips, keep your knees mostly straight, and point your toes behind you."
How to Flutter Kick: Improve Your Swimming & Freestyle,Dog paddle,"Use the dog paddle to stay afloat or swim short distances. Keep your head above water and float from your chest. Alternately move each hand forward and downward, then backward and upward in circular motions under the water. Flutter kick as normal.[13]The dog paddle isnt an official swim stroke, but is fairly intuitive and easy to accomplish (and its named after how your favorite 4-legged companions swim).Move your limbs slowly and let your mouth go under water to save energy. Push and kick faster to raise your head and breathe."
How to Flutter Kick: Improve Your Swimming & Freestyle,Kicking too big,"Keep your legs and kicks in line with your body as much as possible, aiming to keep the amplitude of your kick at about 0.5m (1.6ft) (this means your feet shouldnt move more than this distance above or below your hips). When you start making huge, wide kicks, you end up creating drag which slows you down (and takes a lot more energy).[14]Remember, big kicks don't equal fast swimming. To increase your speed, keep your kicks fast and small."
How to Flutter Kick: Improve Your Swimming & Freestyle,Bending too much at the knees,"Let your knees relax so they bend slightly with the pressure of the water rather than bending them on purpose to propel yourself. These bicycle kicks feel natural, but they ruin your streamlined body position and throw you off balance.[15]Remember to drive your kicks from the hips and to keep your legs fairly straight. This helps with propulsion and counterbalancing your arm strokes.Kicking at the knees will make your legs sink, causing you to slow down and lose your forward-moving momentum."
How to Flutter Kick: Improve Your Swimming & Freestyle,Kicking down instead of backward,"Imagine pushing water backward and away from you with your feet rather than sending it downward. To do this, keep your ankles loose and flexible and your toes pointedif your ankles are stiff or locked, youll have to bend your knee nearly 90 degrees to get any push.[16]Keeping your ankles loose and your toes pointed helps balance your upbeat (the lifting of your leg during a kick) with the downbeat (pushing your leg down)."
How to Prune Tomatoes: 9 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Determine which variety you're growing.,"Before you make any cuts, figure out whether you're growing an indeterminate or determinate variety of tomato plant. Indeterminate varieties grow like vines, and they must be trained upright on poles and pruned in order to grow correctly.[1] Determinate varieties contain themselves before they grow into a bush, and they naturally direct their energy toward fruiting without needing as much intervention. Here are the common varieties of each:Indeterminate: Big Boy, Beef Master, Black Prince, German Queen, most cherry tomato varieties and most heirloom varieties.Determinate:Ace 55, Amelia, Better Bush, Biltmore, Heatmaster, Heinz Classic, Mountain Pride and Patio."
How to Prune Tomatoes: 9 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Check the plant for signs of yellowing.,"One way to know when it is time to start pruning is to wait for the stems and leaves below the first set of flowers to turn yellow. When you notice this color change, you can start pruning.[2]"
How to Prune Tomatoes: 9 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Check for suckers.,"Look for the tiny new branches sprouting in the spot where a branch meets the stem on an indeterminate plant. These are called ""suckers"" and they're what you want to remove. Suckers left to grow will take energy from the rest of the plant and cause the plant to bear more fruits, but can cause the tomatoes to be smaller. This isn't always a bad thing, but strategically removing suckers will help your plant bear large fruit all season long.[3]"
How to Prune Tomatoes: 9 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Look for flowers.,"It is a good idea to start pruning your tomato plants early, as soon as there are flowers on the plants. At this point, the plants should be between 12 and 18 inches.[4]"
How to Prune Tomatoes: 9 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Remove all suckers and their leaves below the first flower cluster.,"Do this no matter what kind of tomato plant you have. This keeps the plant strong by helping it grow a sturdy central stem.  This should ensure that the majority of the nutrients are sent to the fruits, instead of being wasted on the unwanted growing tips.[5]To remove a sucker, grab a growing tip by the base between the thumb and forefinger and bend it back and forth until it snaps cleanly.This should ideally be done when the shoot is young, supple, and about 3 inches (7.6cm) long. The small wound will heal quickly. This is called ""simple pruning"".[6]As for stems and leaves, not the suckers, growing below the first flower cluster: If you live in a warmer zone such as Zone 9, you should leave them on until they turn yellow. They are important for helping to shade the ground until the plant matures. On the other hand, if your plant is in a humid environment (such as a greenhouse), remove everything below the first flower cluster to improve ventilation.  Humidity can make it easier for sicknesses to flourish, and it also causes the wounds that are created while pruning to dry up more slowly making the plant longer vulnerable. By improving ventilation, you're helping to protect the plant."
How to Prune Tomatoes: 9 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Leave the thicker shoots.,"Thicker suckers should not be snapped off, since this could damage the whole plant. If it's thicker than a pencil, use the ""Missouri pruning"" method and pinch out just the tip of the sucker, leaving one or two leaves behind for photosynthesis and to protect developing fruit from sun scald. The drawback is that suckers will develop from the stem that you leave behind, which will require additional pruning. This technique is better when you're dealing with large suckers; if the wound becomes diseased, it will be further away from the main stem. This method also leaves a few inches on the sucker to reduce the shock to the plant.Prune suckers all summer long to keep the plant healthy. They grow quickly, so you may need to prune once or twice a week."
How to Prune Tomatoes: 9 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Pinch off all but four or five fruit bearing trusses for indeterminate varieties.,"These are the branches that grow from the main stem above the first flower cluster. Four or five will produce large, healthy fruit, but any more than that and the fruit will be small and scant. Choose four or five sturdy trusses to keep, then pinch out any additional side shoots, leaving the plant's top shoot intact, known as the terminal shoot.[7]Make sure the vine-like plants are tied to supports after flowering occurs. Otherwise, the vine will grow along the ground and won't produce healthy tomatoes.Determinate plants already have a predetermined number of stems that will naturally grow, so there's no need to do any pruning above the flower cluster. If you prune above the flower cluster, you'll be removing fruit-bearing branches without helping the plant."
How to Prune Tomatoes: 9 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Remove yellow leaves.,"Yellow leaves are leaves that use up more sugar than they produce. As the plant begins to mature, the lower leaves will naturally begin to yellow and wilt. This is perfectly normal, so pull these from the plant when they appear. It will keep the plant fresh and help ward off disease.[8]"
How to Prune Tomatoes: 9 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Top the plant.,"To get the best out of the last growth of the season, it is necessary to ""top"" the plant. About a month before the first expected frost, or when the plant hits the roof of your greenhouse, remove the plant's terminal shoot.[9] At this point in the season, the tomatoes currently growing will have a limited time to reach maturity, so all nutrients must be directed straight to the fruit.[10]"

How to Report Mortgage Fraud: 11 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Report a fraudulent appraisal.,"In theory, everyone wants a house to have a high appraisal value.

If they try to tempt you into talking anyway, tell them ""I will remain silent."" Police officers are trained to use a variety of interrogation techniques which studies found to be very effective at getting people without legal expertise. It is common for police to try and talk to someone before he or she talks to their lawyer. By saying you want to talk to your lawyer first (rather than with them), you not only show them you know your rights, but you know they're trying to trick you into talking.Upon saying ""I want to talk to a lawyer first"", the police may lie (they can legally do that) and say they haven't accused you of anything or doing so implies guilt, respond you are going to remain silent. Most of the time, when the police are under investigation, they immediately ask for a lawyer, so there's no reason why you shouldn't do the same.If you believe that cooperating shows you have nothing to hide, you may want to think again. A study revealed 79% of wrongfully convicted people (who were later exonerated by DNA evidence) had waived their right to an attorney during interrogation.[7]Similarly, if you want to ""come clean"", you also should not talk to the police before your lawyer. The prosecution has the burden of proving your guilt ""beyond a reasonable doubt"", this is not about determining whether you actually did the crime. Without a confession, they may not actually have a strong case against you."
How to Behave if You Get Arrested: 15 Steps (with Pictures),Understand how criminal trials work.,"Each state has its own criminal laws and procedures, but you have a right to a jury trial and due process in all states. During criminal trials, the prosecution has the burden of proving you guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and must provide your attorney all of the evidence (including those favorable to your defense) and list of witnesses during discovery. The prosecutor may offer your lawyer to discuss a plea bargain, which is a deal where you plead guilty to a lesser charge and a lighter sentence to close the case. If a plea bargain is not reached, the lawyers will select and interview a jury (to determine who will hear the case). In trial, lawyers give opening statements, present evidence through witness testimony and exhibits, cross-examine witnesses, make objections, and then conclude with closing arguments. This is where the jury (or judge in bench trials) will determine if the burden was met.The defendant is the person accused of committing a crime and on trial. They have a right to remain silent, not make incriminating statements, take the stand, confront witnesses against them, decide if their case should be heard by jurors or a judge, and accept or reject a plea bargain. They do not have to prove their innocence.The jury consists of 6 to 12 adults who were randomly selected and confirmed by both attorneys to determine if the prosecution has met their burden of proving their case beyond reasonable doubt. After the lawyers deliver their closing statements, the jurors will vote either guilty or not guilty of the charges based on what they observed. If the jurors cannot reach a settlement, it becomes a mistrial and a new panel of jurors will be selected.The criminal defense, prosecutor, and judge are experts in criminal law with different responsibilities:The prosecutor represents the government in building a case against the defendant, proving the elements of crime beyond a reasonable doubt, and secure a conviction.The criminal defense represents the defendant by protecting their legal rights, suppress evidence, and will challenge the prosecution's witness or evidence to create doubt.The judge interprets the law and is responsible for overseeing the case and making sure court rules and procedures are followed, subpoena witnesses, rule on objections (including sign off plea bargains), explain the law and court procedures to the jurors, and if the defendant is found guilty, they will determine the appropriate sentence. Most of them were former lawyers (prosecutors, criminal defense lawyers, or both) before becoming a judge."
How to Behave if You Get Arrested: 15 Steps (with Pictures),Remember everything.,"As soon as you are stopped by the police, you should be trying to build a defense. For example, you should remember as best as you can what the officer said and what you said in return. Remember these details so that you can tell your lawyer later. Also remember the following:Were you told you had the right to remain silent before being questioned? Were you also told you had the right to an attorney? If not, then you can probably get anything you say thrown out of court.Did the officer show you a warrant when they came to your home to arrest you? If not, then the arrest may be unconstitutional.Did you consent to any search? Be honest with your lawyer. If you consented, then you have limited defenses.Were the police rough with you? For example, the police might have sent a dog to bite and hold you without giving you a warning. Or the police might have put you in a choke hold although you werent resisting. Remember these details and tell your lawyer about the force the police used against you. You might be able to file a written complaint later.[8]"
How to Behave if You Get Arrested: 15 Steps (with Pictures),Film the encounter.,"You have a constitutional right to film an encounter with police provided it happens in a public place or on your property.[9] Although some states have tried to make it illegal to record the police on the street, courts keep striking these laws down.However, you must always judge protecting your rights against how angry you might be making the police. Some officers could get aggressive if they dont want to be video recorded. You have to balance preserving evidence against the need to defuse the situation.An alternative to filming is to ask bystanders to take down important information, like the squad car number and the names or descriptions of the officers. These bystanders could be important witnesses in the future."
How to Behave if You Get Arrested: 15 Steps (with Pictures),Ask to call a lawyer.,"Each jail has its own procedures for allowing you to make a phone call. You might need a quarter to call at a pay phone. If you dont have any money, then tell the person in charge.The booking process varies at each jail. You dont have the right to an immediate phone call, so dont start throwing your weight around by yelling, I have the right to a phone call! In fact, if you are aggressive with the police, they might delay your ability to call an attorney.[10]Wait to be booked and then ask, Can I make a phone call now?Also be persistent. The police might process you then forget about you. You might have to ask the officer more than once. Always be polite: I havent had a chance to make my phone call, officer. Can I call now?"
How to Behave if You Get Arrested: 15 Steps (with Pictures),Call a friend or family member.,"Once you get to make a phone call, call someone you know will be home or know will answer their cell phone. This should be a responsible adult, such as a parent or grandparent, and not a friend who might be out partying.In some departments, the police might actually make the call for you. Give them the name and phone number of who you want to call. Police make the call for you so that you dont contact someone and instruct them to destroy evidence or flee the police.If you cant reach anyone on your first call, ask if you can make another. Police have discretion, and generally they will let you make as many calls as you need, provided you are not abusing the privilege.[11]Line up your attorney first. This is your top priority. You can ask to make other phone callse.g., to your boss (to tell them youll miss work) or to arrange day carebut make sure to get a lawyer first."
How to Behave if You Get Arrested: 15 Steps (with Pictures),Request a public defender at your initial appearance.,"After being booked, you may be taken before a judge within 24 hours. This is typically called an initial appearance. The judge should ask you whether you can afford an attorney or if you want a public defender. Tell the judge you want a public defender.You will probably have to complete an application to request a public defender. This application will request personal information, such as your monthly income and assets (bank accounts, life insurance, real estate)."
How to Get Your Horse to Trust You: 10 Steps (with Pictures),Approach your horse correctly.,"If your horse is anxious as you approach him for training, you may be approaching him wrong. Some horses are fearful of humans (or any animals) that approach head-on.Try approaching from the side and avoid direct eye contact.As you get close to your horse, hold your hand out to allow the horse to sniff you. If the horse is still afraid, try bending at the waist while you hold out your hand and avert your gaze."
How to Get Your Horse to Trust You: 10 Steps (with Pictures),Spend time with your horse.,"Other than grooming and riding your horse, how much time do you really spend together? You can learn a lot about a horse's personality and behavioral tendencies by observing your horse for any period of time. Try sitting nearby while your horse roams or interacts with other horses, and let him get comfortable with your presence. You may also get a pretty good idea of why your horse behaves the way he does by watching him and spending time with him.[2]Try to spend some time with your horse every day. Even if you only have 10 or 20 minutes, you can spend that time grooming your horse or squeezing in a short warm-up ride.[3]"
How to Get Your Horse to Trust You: 10 Steps (with Pictures),Talk to your horse.,Some people might feel awkward talking to an animal that can't talk back. But some horse owners find that talking to a horse can help gain the horse's trust and get him used to being around humans. Try speaking to your horse using a calm yet assertive tone. Your horse will learn that he can feel comfortable in your presence and that you are a reliable leader.
How to Get Your Horse to Trust You: 10 Steps (with Pictures),Walk together.,"If your horse hasn't earned your trust yet, riding him for prolonged periods may be difficult or even dangerous. But that doesn't mean you can't get out of the stable with your horse. Try taking your horse for a long walk in the woods, leading him by the reigns as you would lead a dog on a leash. This can help your horse learn to grow comfortable traveling with you and being guided by your lead.[4]"
How to Get Your Horse to Trust You: 10 Steps (with Pictures),Use relaxation techniques to train your horse.,"Part of training your horse and building trust must include learning how to calm your horse. It's important not to rush this part, as forcefully laying your hands on a horse that doesn't trust you could result in further mistrust and even injury. Once your horse gets used to your touch, you can use a variety of relaxation techniques to help facilitate training if your horse is being stubborn or fearful.Stand next to your horse's head, facing the same direction as he is. Hold the lead rope in your hand and slowly bend down at the waist with your head down. Gently guide the horse's head down with you. This should pull your horse out of his alert, guarded pose, and over time he will see that he can safely let his guard down around you.Stroke or scratch your horse, but don't pat him. Patting is not something that horses do to each other in the wild. Stroking or scratching mimics the way a horse might rub against another horse in the wild, and it's the best way to soothe an anxious horse and get him used to your touch.Use an index finger to gently stroke the groove that runs down the top of your horse's muzzle. Stroke gently and run your finger down the entire length of the muzzle. This can be incredibly relaxing in some horses, and will help desensitize your horse to your touch.Hold your horse's muzzle with one hand and gently slide one finger from your other hand into the back corner of your horse's mouth. Horses shouldn't have teeth in that part of the mouth, but it's still important to proceed cautiously. Don't force this exercise if your horse still isn't comfortable being touched by you. Once your finger is in, gently and very briefly stroke your horse's tongue. This teaches the horse to submit to you, and over time will earn his trust."
How to Get Your Horse to Trust You: 10 Steps (with Pictures),Train in increments.,"This might sound like common sense, but it's easy to forget that expecting too much too soon from an animal can be stressful and confusing. Training is a great way to build trust with your horse, but it should be done in a scaffolded approach. Start with small, easy to accomplish tasks and work your way up to more challenging training lessons.Start with what your horse already knows. Then add easy challenges that you know he will be able to accomplish without too much effort.If your horse isn't ready to jump over a new obstacle, that's okay. Get him comfortable standing near the obstacle and smelling/looking at it, so that, over time, he'll be comfortable and mentally prepared to jump over the obstacle.Don't rush your horse. If he's still not comfortable jumping over obstacles, forcing him to jump will only make him more distrustful of you, and could cause harm to both you and your horse. Let your horse investigate the obstacle as much as he needs to before he's ready to jump over it, and be sure he's comfortable being around the obstacle before you attempt to jump it."
How to Get Your Horse to Trust You: 10 Steps (with Pictures),Reward successful training.,"Any time you train your horse to accomplish a new task and he attempts the challenge, give him a reward, even if he doesn't fully accomplish the task. The key is to teach your horse that it's advantageous to try for you. Eventually, with enough reassurance and reward, your horse will want to try for you, not just for a treat.Choose healthy treats as rewards. Vegetables like apples, carrots, and celery make excellent treats for horses if cut into small enough pieces.[5]Do not give your horse vegetables that tend to cause gas like cabbage or Brussels sprouts. Never give your horse any plants from the nightshade family, including onions, potatoes, tomatoes, eggplant, and peppers.[6]Always give treats in moderation. Giving too many treats or giving treats too often can also create problems like constant expectations of food, which can lead to nipping. For this reason, it's important to set some kind of boundaries when it comes to how you reward your horse's behavior. Generally speaking, one or two pieces of horse-appropriate vegetables should suffice as a treat or reward.[7]Be cautious with hand-feeding your horse treats. If your horse doesn't trust you yet, he might try to snatch treats as quickly as possible, which could result in your hand getting bit. Instead, offer treats in a bucket or feeding trough.[8]"
How to Get Your Horse to Trust You: 10 Steps (with Pictures),Confront his fears.,"If your horse has certain anxieties - like crossing water, for example - you'll need to help your horse confront those fears. But that doesn't mean you should force your horse to run recklessly into whatever he's afraid of. Forcing a horse to confront a fear too quickly could frighten the horse and may cause injury to you, but over time he should confront those fears. The best part about helping your horse confront his fears is that he'll remember your role in the process, and he should come to respect and trust you.[9]Build your horse's confidence by leading him to whatever he's afraid of - say a creek that runs across your property.Use relaxation techniques to calm your horse, then lead him slowly toward the water. Let him watch the water, sniff the shore, and once he feels comfortable stepping into the water, let him stand in the water for a few moments to understand that it's not a threat."
How to Get Your Horse to Trust You: 10 Steps (with Pictures),Recognize your own fears.,"If your horse hasn't learned to trust you, you might be part of the problem. Horses can sense when a rider is tense or anxious, and any hesitation on your part could cause your horse to lose his trust and confidence in you. Try confronting your riding fears with your horse, using relaxation techniques and a soothing but confident voice. As you get more comfortable riding your horse through scenarios that previously made you nervous, your horse should get more comfortable confronting those scenarios with you.[10]"
How to Get Your Horse to Trust You: 10 Steps (with Pictures),Consider lessons for your horse.,"If you simply can't earn your horse's trust, you might need to hire a professional. Professional trainers can work with you and your horse to learn why your horse may be reluctant to trust you, and can teach you how to overcome those obstacles.[11]Bucking, bolting, and rearing up are all examples of bad horse behavior that need to be corrected. These actions are generally caused by your horse not trusting or respecting you, and can cause serious harm to you or other riders. If your horse engages in any of these behaviors, contact a qualified horse trainer before any further attempts at riding your horse.Look for a trainer or other qualified expert through a professional organization, like the American Quarter Horse Association. Search online for a trainer near you."
How to Calculate Adverse Impact: 9 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Understand the test.,"The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Labor, the Department of Justice, and the Office of Personnel Management have all adopted a test known as the ""four-fifths rule"" to calculate adverse impact.[4] This test compares the rates of selection for lesser-represented classes of individuals against the rate at which the most-represented group is selected. If any lesser-represented group has a selection rate that is less than four-fifths (or 80%) of the selection rate for the most-represented group, this can be used as evidence that discriminationor adverse impactis present.[5][6]So, if 90% of men who apply for a particular position are selected, and women are selected for the same position at a rate lower than 72% (80% of the highest selection rate, 90%), this would be evidence of adverse impact."
How to Calculate Adverse Impact: 9 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Identify the policy or practice at issue.,"To demonstrate adverse impact, a plaintiff must show that a particular policy or practice on the part of an employer results in a certain amount of discrimination towards a protected group. Therefore, your first step should be to identify the selection requirement that is responsible for the differing rates of selection.By way of example, let's use a requirement that, to be a police officer in a particular city, an applicant must be able to lift at least 100 pounds.[7]"
How to Calculate Adverse Impact: 9 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Calculate the rate of selection for each group.,"The next step in calculating adverse impact is to establish the selection rates for each group of individuals. This is done, for each group, by dividing the number of applicants selected for employment by the total number of applicants. These selection rates will then be compared in a later step.Returning to our example, let's say 100 men and 100 women applied to be police officers in our hypothetical city. 80 men and 60 women were selected for the position.So, the selection rate for men would be 80% (80/100) and the selection rate for women would be 60% (60/100)."
How to Calculate Adverse Impact: 9 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Note which group has the highest selection rate.,"The next step in this process is to determine which group has the highest selection rate. This rate will be used as the point of comparison on which a determination of adverse impact can be made.In our example, men have the highest selection rate for the police-office position, at 80%."
How to Calculate Adverse Impact: 9 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Calculate adverse impact ratios.,"Once you have calculated the selection rates and determined the group with the highest rate, the next step is to determine the ""adverse impact ratio"" for each other group, which represents how each group's selection rate compares with the most-represented group's rate of selection. This is done by comparing the selection rate for each group against that of the most-represented group, in which you are basically comparing the rate for the adverse group with the rate for the favored group by dividing the former by the latter. In our example, we would divide the selection rate for women by the selection rate for men (.60/.80) and arrive at an adverse impact ratio for female applicants of 75%."
How to Calculate Adverse Impact: 9 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Determine if adverse impact exists.,"Once you have calculated the adverse impact ratios for each group, evaluate each adverse impact ratio using the four-fifths rule. This is the simple part. If the adverse impact ratio for a particular group is less than 80%, according to the four-fifths rule this can be used as evidence that the employment policy, practice, or procedure is discriminatory in some way towards that group. Basically, this means that a member of the less-represented group is selected for a position less than 80% of the time a member of the most-represented group is selected for the same position, which many federal agencies consider evidence that discrimination is taking place.Returning to our example, the impact ratio for female applicants is 75%, which is less than 80%, meaning that the policy of requiring police officers to be able to lift at least 100 pounds seems to have an adverse impact on female applicants.While the four-fifths rule is not controlling in court, it is consistently recognized by courts as a proper factor for courts to consider when determining if adverse impact is present in an employment-discrimination case.[8]"
How to Calculate Adverse Impact: 9 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Demonstrate adverse impact.,"The first step in proving a case of disparate-impact employment discriminationwhere a plaintiff argues that an employer's practice or policy results in discrimination against a protected groupis to establish causation. That is, that the policy caused discrimination on the basis of a protected status (e.g., race, religion, or sex).[9]There is no constant standard courts use to satisfy this causation requirement.[10] While many federal agencies have explicitly endorsed the four-fifths rule detailed above, other courts have rejected it. The only guidance given by the Supreme Court on this issue is that statistical disparities must be ""sufficiently substantial"" to the point that they suggest causation between the disputed employment practice and a lower selection rate for a protected group of individuals.[11]So, if we continue with our above example, the selection criteria of requiring police officers to be able to lift at least 100 pounds would seem to have an adverse impact on female applicants according to the four-fifths rule."
How to Calculate Adverse Impact: 9 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Take note of the employer's justification.,"After the plaintiff has demonstrated the existence of adverse impact (e.g., by using the four-fifths rule), the employer is given the opportunity to show that the disputed policy or practice is job-related and serves some business necessity.[12][13]For example, the police department might claim that, in its view, police officers should be able to lift a minimum amount of weight because this signifies a certain amount of physical fortitude and conditioning necessary to carry out the duties of a police officer. Therefore, the requirement that all police officers be able to lift at least 100 pounds is not meant to discriminate against women, but is instead meant to ensure an optimal level of physical fitness throughout the city's police force."
How to Calculate Adverse Impact: 9 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Show that an alternative practice is less discriminatory.,"If the employer is able to provide a justification for the disputed practice, a plaintiff can still win in a disparate-impact case if the plaintiff can point to a different practice the employer could have used instead (but didn't) that would have resulted in less discrimination.[14][15]So, the police department in our example justified the 100-pound requirement by stating it wants its officers to maintain a certain level of physical fitness. A plaintiff could argue that, instead of using weightlifting ability as a measure of physical fitness, the department could have used a different, less-discriminatory measure, such as medical physical-fitness evaluation prior to beginning employment, or mandatory participation in physical-fitness training after accepting employment as a police officer."

Subtract in (0.64cm) for species with thin bark, such as birch. If youre not sure and just want a rough estimate, subtract in (1.3cm) from the radius.[3]Including the bark would add extra girth and throw off your measurements."
4 Ways to Determine the Age of a Tree - wikiHow,Use nearby fallen trees to calculate an average ring width.,"Check around the tree in question for dead or fallen trees of the same species. If you find one with visible rings, measure the radius and count the rings. Then divide the radius by the number of rings to find the average ring width.[4]Suppose theres a nearby stump with a radius of 25in (64cm), and you count 125 rings. The average ring width would be in (0.51cm).Growth rates vary by tree species and environmental conditions. The living tree youre measuring probably grew at a rate similar to a tree of the same species that grew nearby.Youll plug your ring width measurement or, if there are no nearby stumps, an average growth rate into an equation to estimate the trees age.Even if you have the average ring width, you can also use the average growth rate to estimate the age, then compare the results of the 2 methods."
4 Ways to Determine the Age of a Tree - wikiHow,"Look up the species average growth rate, if necessary.","If you cant find any nearby stumps or felled trees, search online for the average growth rate for the species of the tree youre measuring. Including your location in your search terms could yield more accurate results. In general, a tree is probably around 8-15 years old for every 1ft (0.30m) of trunk diameter. For instance, if the circumference of a tree is 6ft (1.8m) around, it's probably at least 50 years old if it's a hardwood.[5]For example, oak, ash, beech, and sycamore trees grow about  to in (1.3 to 1.9cm) in circumference per year. If you dont know the species, plug both in (1.3cm) and in (1.9cm) into your equation to guess an age rage.For a more accurate estimate, factor in the trees location. In open conditions, growth rates are usually greater, or  to 1in (1.9 to 2.5cm) per year. Growth tends to be slower in urban locations and crowded forests.Be sure to check how the growth rate is calculated. Many sources base growth rates on how much the trees girth, or circumference, grows per year. However, you might find rates based on the average ring width of the radius."
4 Ways to Determine the Age of a Tree - wikiHow,Divide the radius by the average ring width.,"If you used a nearby stump to calculate the average ring width, divide the radius of the living tree in question by the average ring width.[6]Say that, excluding the bark, your tree has a radius of about 24 in (60.96 cm). Using a nearby tree stump of the same species, you calculated an average ring width of 0.20 in (0.508 cm).Divide 24 (or 60.96) by 0.20 (or 0.508) to come up with an estimated age of 120 years."

Divide 154 (or 391.16) by 0.75 (or 1.905), then divide 154 (or 391.16) by 1 (or 2.54). Your estimated age range would be between 154 and 205 years old."
4 Ways to Determine the Age of a Tree - wikiHow,Count whorls to estimate the age of a conifer.,"Whorls are rows of branches that grow from the trunk at approximately the same height. Counting whorls is an option for conifers, or evergreen trees, but isnt very useful for broadleaf trees, like oak or sycamore. This method isn't as accurate as counting the rings, but it's a way to estimate the tree's age without having to kill or injure it.[7]Conifers produce whorls annually at regular intervals. Deciduous, or broadleaf trees, produce them irregularly, making it difficult to get an accurate count.Its also easiest to count the whorls of a young conifer. You might not be able to see the top of a tall, mature conifer, and there would be more irregularities in its growth patterns."
4 Ways to Determine the Age of a Tree - wikiHow,Count the rows of branches growing at the same height.,"At the base of the tree, look for a row of branches that grow at the same level, a bare length of trunk, then another row of branches. These rows are the whorls; count them until youve reached the top of the tree.[8]You might see single branches growing between whorls or 2 whorls spaced closely together. These are irregularities that might indicate an injury or unusual weather conditions that year, so dont count them."
4 Ways to Determine the Age of a Tree - wikiHow,Include any stubs or knots at the bottom of the trunk.,"Check beneath the first row of branches for evidence of prior growth. Look for knots in the trunk and stubs where branches once grew, which youll count as additional whorls.[9]For instance, suppose your tree has 8 recognizable whorls. Beneath the first row, you can see a few stubs that emerge from the trunk around the same level. There's also a row of 2 or 3 knots under the stubs. Youd count the stubs and knots as additional whorls, so your total count would be 10."
4 Ways to Determine the Age of a Tree - wikiHow,Add 2 to 4 years to account for seedling growth.,"The tree germinated and grew as a seedling for a few years before it started sprouting woody whorls. Add 2 to 4 to your whorl count to factor in this early growth.[10]If your whorl count was 10, your final age estimate would be between 12 and 14 years."
4 Ways to Determine the Age of a Tree - wikiHow,Examine the rings of an exposed stump.,"The number of rings on a stump indicates the number of years the tree lived. Youll see rings of darker and lighter bands; 1 year of growth is composed of both a dark and light band. Since theyre easier to distinguish, count the dark bands to estimate the age.The rings can also tell you about the environmental conditions for a particular year. Thinner rings represent colder or dryer years, and thicker rings represent better growing conditions."
4 Ways to Determine the Age of a Tree - wikiHow,Sand the stump to see the rings more clearly.,"If the rings are hard to make out, start by sanding them with coarse, 60-grit sandpaper. Finish with a very fine sandpaper, such as 400-grit. Spraying the surface lightly with water can also make the rings easier to see.You might find that some rings are too close together to see clearly. If necessary, use a magnifying glass to get a better view."
4 Ways to Determine the Age of a Tree - wikiHow,Count the rings from the pith to the bark.,"Find the pith, or the small circle at the center of the concentric rings. Start counting from the first dark band around the pith. Continue counting until youve reached the bark. The last ring is pressed up against the bark and hard to see, so make sure to include it in your count.[11]If you have trouble keeping track, try writing a number or making a mark every 10 rings with a pencil."
4 Ways to Determine the Age of a Tree - wikiHow,Take a core sample of a living tree using an increment borer.,"To accurately estimate the age of a living tree without killing it, use a borer to take a core sample. An increment borer is a T-shaped instrument composed of an augur, or a bit, and an extractor, which fits into the augur. The end of the T-shape is a handle, which you turn to drill in and out of the tree. The length of your increment borer should be at least 75% of the tree's diameter. You can find increment borers online and at forestry supply stores."
4 Ways to Determine the Age of a Tree - wikiHow,Drill into the trunk at breast height.,"Measure ft (1.4m) up the trunk from ground level. Position the borers bit at that height on the middle of the trunk.[12]Taking a sample at breast height gives you an estimate called the DBH age. You'll need to add 5 to 10 years to the DBH age to estimate the trees total age.You'll take the sample at breast height because its not practical to take one at the trees base. Roots, brush, and the ground would prevent you from turning the handle, and its hard to drill while crouching or lying on the ground."
4 Ways to Determine the Age of a Tree - wikiHow,Bore just past the trunks estimated center point.,"Apply firm pressure and turn the handle clockwise to drill into the tree trunk. Continue turning until you think youve drilled around 2 to 3in (5.1 to 7.6cm) passed the pith, or the center of the trunk.[13]Calculate the trees radius to estimate how far youll need to drill. Measure the trees circumference, divide by pi (about 3.14) to find the diameter, then divide the diameter by 2 to find the radius."
4 Ways to Determine the Age of a Tree - wikiHow,"Insert the extractor, then turn the handle counterclockwise.","The extractor is a long tube with teeth at an end. It fits into the augur, or the part that youve drilled into the tree. Slide in the extractor, then turn the handles clockwise to remove the instrument and extract a core sample.[14]"
4 Ways to Determine the Age of a Tree - wikiHow,"Remove the sample and locate the pith, or the center of the trunk.","After sliding the core sample out of the extractor, youll see an array of curved concentric lines. These are sections of the trees rings. You should see a dot at the interior end (opposite the bark end) of the core sample that marks the center point of the concentric rings.

How to Account for Goodwill Impairment: 7 Steps (with Pictures),Learn the definition of goodwill.,"Understanding goodwill impairment is impossible without understanding goodwill. Goodwill is something that occurs when one business purchases another business for more than the fair market value of that business. In other words, accountants would determine what the business should be worth on the open market (or the fair market value), and if the business is purchased for more than this value, goodwill is created.[1]For example, assume Company A has a fair market value of $1 million. Company B decides to pay $2 million to buy company A. In doing so, Company B pays $1 million more than the fair market value of Company A, and therefore, $1 million in goodwill is created (purchase price of $2 million minus fair market value of $1 million).Why is company B willing to pay $1 million more than Company A is worth? There are a variety of reasons. Company A may have excellent growth prospects, strong profit margins, a competitive edge, or be an excellent fit with Company B's current business model.After the purchase, Company B would show $1 million in goodwill on its balance sheet, and $1 million indicating the value of the business."
How to Account for Goodwill Impairment: 7 Steps (with Pictures),Calculate carrying value (also known as book value) of a business.,"Recall that goodwill is created when you pay more than for a company than what the company's assets are actually worth. What the company's assets are actually worth is known as the carrying value. It is known as carrying value because this is the value of the business that is ""carried"" on the balance sheet.The carrying value of a business is equal to the cost that was originally paid for the business's assets, minus its debts. For example, if a business originally paid $2 million for its assets, and it has debts of $1 million, its carrying value would be $1 million.Sometimes the carrying value of a company will be worth less than its fair market value, or what the market is willing to pay for it. Recall that goodwill is equal to the purchase price of a business minus the fair market value. For example, assume the carrying value of a company is $1 million and accountants determine the fair market value is $1.5 million. If somebody is willing to pay $2 million, the goodwill created would be $500,000, or $2 million minus $1.5 million."
How to Account for Goodwill Impairment: 7 Steps (with Pictures),Understand Goodwill Impairment.,"Each year, it is required that you test Goodwill for something known as impairment. Over time, the value of your business may fluctuate with market conditions, or with the performance of your business. Sometimes, poor market conditions or performance could mean that the market value will decrease below the carrying value recorded on the balance sheet. If this happens, it is necessary to decrease, or impair, the goodwill on the balance sheet to reflect the decrease in value.[2]For example, assume you purchased a business for $2 million. Both the carrying value and fair market value in this case are $1 million, but it was decided for various reasons that you would pay $2 million due to strong advantages the business has. In this case, $1 million in goodwill is createdIf a new competitor appears in the market that strongly reduces the business's sales, your business would be worth less if you tried to sell it. If the value of your business falls so that it is worth less than the carrying value (in this case, $1 million), it is necessary to reduce the goodwill by the difference between what the business is now worth, and what it is recorded as being worth on your balance sheet.For example, assume the balance sheet indicates a carrying value of $1 million, plus $1 million in Goodwill. If something bad happens to your business and it is now only worth $500,000 on the open market, you would need to reduce, or impair the goodwill by $500,000."
How to Account for Goodwill Impairment: 7 Steps (with Pictures),Determine the reporting unit in question.,"Goodwill impairment is performed on a ""reporting unit"" basis. A reporting unit is a segment of the business that is autonomous enough to provide discrete financial information. For example, consider a firm called Vet Corporation that purchases veterinary practices in the hopes of increasing each practice's profits due to centralized management. Each practice the firm buys would be considered a reporting unit.In this case, perhaps Vet Corporation has purchased 10 veterinary practices. Each practice would be a separate reporting unit. This means that each practice would have its own carrying value, and own unique value in the market place if Vet Corporation ever decided to sell it."
How to Account for Goodwill Impairment: 7 Steps (with Pictures),Estimate the fair market value of each reporting unit annually.,"Pretend that Vet Corporation recently purchased the veterinary practice of Dr. Brown. You must determine what this practice is now worth on the open market, so you can compare it to the carrying value to determine if impairment is necessary.Calculating what a business should be worth on the open market is complex, and therefore you should enlist the assistance of a chartered accountant or financial analyst.You can get a rough idea on your own by looking at the price that similar transactions have gone for in the market. You can also look at historical data to assume what average prices are. For example, if a similar vet practice recently sold for 10 times its annual profits, you can assume yours would sell for a similar price.Assume, for example, that it was determined the market value of Dr. Brown's practice was worth $800,000."
How to Account for Goodwill Impairment: 7 Steps (with Pictures),Compare the market value of the reporting unit to its carrying value.,"The carrying value of the unit in this case is the value of the company's assets (or the value they were purchased for), minus any debts. Assume the carrying value of Dr. Brown's practice is $900,000.This means if you look on your balance sheet, you would see a carrying value of $900,000. This may mean assets of $1 million, minus debts of $100,000, for example.If the market value is higher than the carrying value, you can conclude that no goodwill impairment is necessary. If the market value is lower than the carrying value, you must proceed to the next step of the impairment test - determining the cause of this difference.In this example, the market value is lower than the carrying value by $100,000."
How to Account for Goodwill Impairment: 7 Steps (with Pictures),Record the journal entry to recognize the goodwill impairment.,"Open whatever accounting software you are using to make the appropriate journal entries for the impairment. In this example, goodwill must be impaired by $100,000. To record the journal entry, Vet Corporation should debit Loss on Goodwill Impairment for $100,000, and credit Goodwill for $100,000.[3]This transaction does two things. First, by crediting goodwill, the goodwill account is reduced by $100,000. This reflects the fact that the business is now worth $100,000 less than is recorded, so the goodwill asset account is reduced by this amount to account for the difference.By debiting Loss on Goodwill Impairment, you are recording the fact that a loss of $100,000 has occurred, which will appear on the income statement as an expense. This is because accounting rules require that any loss of goodwill not only reduce the amount of goodwill on the balance sheet, but also be recorded as an expense on the income statement. This means your profits would be $100,000 less for the year."

How to Treat a Facial Burn from a Curling Iron to Prevent Scars,Identify the kind of burn you have.,"There are three kinds of burns you can get on your skin. Each type requires a different kind of treatment, so youll need to be sure what you have before doing anything else.[1]First-degree burns are the most common and least serious. These are minor burns that you can treat yourself. A first-degree burn will have redness, swelling, and pain.[2] If the burn involves most of your face, though, treat it more seriously and get emergency medical help.Second-degree burns are more serious, and your treatment will depend on the size of the burn. A second-degree burn may have red, white, or splotchy skin, swelling, pain, and blisters. If the burn is 3 inches or smaller, you can treat it like a minor burn. If it is larger, treat like a major burn and get medical help immediately.Third-degree burns are the most serious, and involve burning off all the skin and underlying fat.

If your life goal is to become a pilot, a degree in social work is less likely to help you work towards that larger goal."

(Some people call these macro and micro goals).  These will make the larger goal a bit more digestible and will give you opportunities to celebrate as you reach small goals along the way.If you find yourself hesitating to start working towards your goal because your end goal is overwhelming, try forgetting about it and focusing instead on your first milestone goal.For example, if you want to lose 45 pounds over the course of 2 years, don't worry about that final number of 45.  Just start with your first goal, which might be losing 5 pounds.Try making a reverse calendar.  If you start with the (time-bound) end goal, you should be able to work your way backwards in time, setting milestones or shorter goals to achieve until you get to the present day.  You may have to revise your calendar a few times to fit everything in your given time frame (or you may need to reevaluate the end-time of your final goal).A reverse calendar will help give you a specific starting point and can help you make the first step, which is often the hardest."

If you want to make a big change, however, you are going to have to make yourself uncomfortable.  Don't worry, though; these feelings of discomfort can lead you to grow and experience things outside of your current experiences.This is another place where micro or smaller goals can benefit you.  If you think of going from your current state to your end goal, it's likely to be a big, intimidating change.  However, if you think of going from where you are now to your first milestone goal, it's likely to be a less frightening prospect.For example, imagine that you have an office job that makes you unhappy and you set the following goal: Become a registered nurse working in an emergency room in the next 3 years.  Jumping straight into that environment may seem terrifying.  But working towards your first goal or applying for nursing school is just slightly outside of your comfort zone.Allow yourself to feel a little uncomfortable as you work towards each new step or level of your goal, and to grow from that feeling.

7 Signs an Avoidant Loves You—Even if They’re Bad at Showing It,They start to open up emotionally.,"Emotional intimacy is a big deal for avoidants. Their avoidant attachment style means they usually go through life without sharing what theyre thinking or experiencing inside. If your avoidant partner starts to share how theyre feeling with you or open up about their deepest secrets, its a sign they trust you and are getting attached to you.[1]Keep in mind that an avoidants idea of opening up might be very subtle compared to an anxiously or securely attached person's version of emotional vulnerability, and what may be hard for your avoidant to share with you might come across to you as no big deal."
7 Signs an Avoidant Loves You—Even if They’re Bad at Showing It,They engage in nonverbal PDA.,"Because avoidants can easily get uncomfortable or overwhelmed by verbal expressions of love, they often show their feelings with their actions, meaning they may be more likely to kiss you than to tell you they love you directly. Try initiating PDA with your avoidant partner and see how they respond. If they reciprocate rather than avoid your touch, its a sign theyre becoming more comfortable in the relationship.[2]If your avoidant partner doesnt respond to your PDA, it can sting! But it doesnt necessarily mean they dont care or wont reciprocate in the future. They may just need time.Keep in mind that avoidant people are often more amenable to private displays of affection, so if you try to hold hands at the mall and they withdraw, try not to take it too personally. Reach for their hand when youre alone at home and theyll be more likely to reciprocate.Because avoidants are so uncomfortable with intimacy and may not have had that much practice with it, they might be super awkward when they do it! Be as encouraging as you can, and celebrate their efforts. Theyll get better at it!"
7 Signs an Avoidant Loves You—Even if They’re Bad at Showing It,They listen to you.,"For avoidants, getting close to a romantic partneror anyone, for that mattercan be a scary thing. They tend towell, avoid it. If your partner actively listens to you when you speak and is curious about you, its a sign theyre attached to you and they care deeply for you.[3]If they put their phone down when they're hanging out with you, it's a big sign they're invested in what you're saying.Other signs they're actively listening and engaged when you speak include maintaining eye contact (this can be hard for an avoidant person to do!), nodding, and giving responses that further the conversation."
7 Signs an Avoidant Loves You—Even if They’re Bad at Showing It,They go out of their way to spend time with you.,"For many avoidants, the idea of falling for someone is terrifying because they worry, deep down, that they might lose the person they love. So they often try to keep people at a distance for as long as they can out of reluctance to take things to a deeper level. This being said, if your avoidant partner prioritizes you and goes out of their way to spend time with you, theyre likely in love. Big, big love.An avoidant in love will try to spend as much time with you as they can. Sure, theyre an avoidant, so theyll still need a decent amount of space. But theyll need way less space with you than with everyone else."
7 Signs an Avoidant Loves You—Even if They’re Bad at Showing It,They try to get to know you better.,"You might notice your avoidant making little efforts to bond with you. Maybe theyll ask you about your likes and dislikes, or theyll invite you to participate in a shared activity to give you the chance to grow closer and get to know each other better.

7 Signs an Avoidant Loves You—Even if They’re Bad at Showing It,Be patient and dont rush them to commit.,"Avoidant people want love just as much as the rest of us non-avoidant people, but they have more difficulty committing, even when they want to. If you are patient and don't pressure your avoidant partner to go faster than they're comfortable with, over time, they may slowly start to feel safer in the relationship. Essentially, the way to have a thriving partnership with an avoidant is to justlet them be themselves and not put any pressure on them.[5]This doesnt mean you should let your avoidant partners needs outweigh your own, and needing some level of commitment from your partner is a very valid thing. But if you want to be with an avoidant, youve got to go slow."
7 Signs an Avoidant Loves You—Even if They’re Bad at Showing It,Show them you love themdon't just say it.,"Just like avoidants are more likely to show they love you with their actions, theyre more receptive to actions from you rather than big proclamations of undying devotion. That doesnt mean you cant still tell them you love them, especially if words of affirmation is your love language, but try to back up your words with deeds too.[6]"
7 Signs an Avoidant Loves You—Even if They’re Bad at Showing It,Give them plenty of space.,"The poet Rainer Maria Rilke said that in an ideal romantic relationship, both parties stand guard over the solitude of the other. For many avoidants, this rings true: they may truly want a relationship deep down, but they might feel like they cant be in a couple without losing their independence. Show your avoidant this isnt the case by encouraging them to take space for themselves regularly and by taking alone time for yourself as well. Theyll appreciate the room to breathe.[7]Some avoidants may initiate taking time to themselves, but others may worry that asking for time apart will upset their securely or anxiously attached partners, and theyll choose to suffer in silence instead.If your avoidant hasnt had much alone time lately, try asking them if theyd like any. Theyll not only appreciate the offer; theyll be glad to know you understand their need for space."
7 Signs an Avoidant Loves You—Even if They’re Bad at Showing It,Communicate calmly and clearly during arguments.,"In serious conversations, heightened emotions can cause an avoidant to shut down. Its hard, but using calm, clear language, not raising your voice, and not giving in to big displays of emotion during a tough discussion can make all the difference in a relationship with an avoidant. Theyll be more likely to actually hear what youre saying and not shut you out or just say what you want to hear.Using I statements may help your avoidant partner feel less defensive and more receptive to what youre saying. In serious discussions, avoidant people can feel easily threatened by you statementsas in, You need to hug me more, or Its your fault we arent more intimate.Opt for I statements that reflect your role, your needs, and your feelings: I wish you would hug me more, or Id like to be more intimate.Try not to raise your voice during serious discussions. If an argument starts to get too heated (for either of you), communicate that you're feeling too upset to talk in the moment, that you love them, and that you want to pick up the conversation again later when you've both had some time to rest and reflect."
7 Signs an Avoidant Loves You—Even if They’re Bad at Showing It,Be consistent and reliable.,"Because avoidants are so slow to trust, erratic behavior or failing to follow through on your promises can cause them to withdraw. Follow through on your promises and show youre dedicated to your partner and the relationship, and you and your avoidant stand a good chance of having a long and happy relationship."
7 Signs an Avoidant Loves You—Even if They’re Bad at Showing It,Avoid prioritizing your partners needs over your own.,"While dating an avoidant can take a lot of effort, this doesnt mean you need to neglect your own needs in your relationship. In a thriving partnership, both parties feel heard and seennot just one of them. So while you may need to be patient with some aspects of your avoidant partners attachment style, its imperative that youre free to communicate your own needs as well and that you BOTH put in the effort to make each other feel safe, happy, and loved.Avoidant people may have difficulty being intimate with their partners, which can leave their partners feeling neglected, rejected, or unwanted. The responsibility doesnt lie solely on your shoulders to make the relationship work.[8]Communicating your needs to your avoidant may involve being calm and patient so they dont shut down emotionally, but that doesnt mean you cant be forthright about how youre feeling and what you need from them."
7 Signs an Avoidant Loves You—Even if They’re Bad at Showing It,An avoidant person can learn to become more secure over time.,"You arent responsible for changing your avoidant partners attachment style, but being in a stable relationship can help an avoidant person learn to be more securely attached. Openly communicate how their avoidant behavior makes you feel, and gradually, they may learn to become more secure.[9]If youre with your avoidant long-term, they might still be generally aloof, but youre more likely to see signs of their attachment to you over time as they learn to trust you and get more comfortable showing you how they feel.Therapy can help people with insecure attachments work on their attachment styles. Whether you and your partner seek couples counseling or they go to solo counseling, talking through their attachment issues can help them learn to become more emotionally open and comfortable with intimacy."
How to Write a Villanelle: Structure & Examples,Learn the rules of a villanelle.,"The villanelle has 19 lines, split into 5 tercets (three-line stanzas) and 1 quatrain (a stanza of 4 lines). There are two repeating rhymes and two ""refrains,"" or repeated lines.[2]The 1st and 3rd lines alternate as the last lines of stanzas 2, 3, and 4. The last stanza uses the 1st and 3rd lines as a rhymed couplet. If we use capitals for the refrains and lowercase letters for the rhymes, the form could be expressed as: A1 b A2 / a b A1 / a b A2 / a b A1 / a b A2 / a b A1 A2.[3]There is no set meter in a villanelle but there is a set rhyme scheme. There is no fixed number of syllables for each line in a villanelle.[4]The villanelle is broken into three parts: the introduction, the development, and the conclusion. Most villanelles build up intensity and tone until they reach the conclusion.[5]"
How to Write a Villanelle: Structure & Examples,Look at the structure.,"The easiest way to do this is to break down a villanelle line by line, such as ""Villanelle of Change"" by Edward Arlington Robinson.[6] Let's look at the first stanza of the poem:line A1- first refrain - Since Persia fell at Marathonline b - The yellow years have gathered fastline A2 - second refrain - Long centuries have come and gone."
How to Write a Villanelle: Structure & Examples,Note the second stanza of the poem.,"The second stanza will use the same first refrain, but line ""b"" line will be different. The line ""a"" will rhyme with the first refrain, ""A1"". The line ""b"" will rhyme with line ""b"" in the first stanza.[7]line a - And yet (they say) the place will donline b - A phantom fury of the past,line A1 - Since Persia fell at Marathon;"
How to Write a Villanelle: Structure & Examples,Look at the third stanza of the poem.,"The third stanza will use the same second refrain. Line ""a"" will rhyme with the second refrain, ""A2"". Line ""b"" will rhyme with line ""b"" in the previous stanza.[8]line a - And as of old when Heliconline b - Trembled and swayed with rapture vastline A2 - (Long centuries have come and gone),"
How to Write a Villanelle: Structure & Examples,Note the fourth stanza of the poem.,"The fourth stanza will use the same first refrain, A1. Line a will rhyme with the first refrain. Line b will rhyme with the line b in the previous stanza.[9]line 10 - a - The ancient plain, when night comes on,line 11 - b - Shakes to a ghostly battle-blast,line 12 - A1 - Since Persia fell at Marathon."
How to Write a Villanelle: Structure & Examples,Look at the fifth stanza of the poem.,"The fifth stanza will use the same second refrain. Line ""a"" will rhyme with the second refrain, ""A2"". Line ""b"" will rhyme with line ""b"" in the previous stanza.[10]line 13 - a - But into soundless Acheronline 14 - b - The glory of Greek shame was cast:line 15 - A2 - Long centuries have come and gone,"
How to Write a Villanelle: Structure & Examples,Note the sixth and final stanza of the poem.,"Line a will rhyme with the first refrain, A1. Line b will rhyme with the line b in the previous stanza. The poem then ends with the first refrain, A1 and the second refrain, A2.[11]line 16 - a - The suns of Hellas have all shone,line 17 - b - The first has fallen to the last;--line 18 - A1 - Since Persia fell at Marathon,line 19 - A2 - Long centuries have come and gone."
How to Write a Villanelle: Structure & Examples,Read examples of the villanelle.,"There are several well known examples of the form, where the use of the refrain becomes a powerful way to underscore or undercut the previous lines in the stanza.[12] For example:Dylan Thomas' ""Do Not Go Gentle Into that Good Night""[13] is one of the most famous examples of the villanelle form. Thomas poem uses the villanelle structure to deepen the meaning of each stanza.Elizabeth Bishop's ""One Art"" includes text in parenthesis and dashes. Bishop also does a variation on the refrain lines that deviates from the form and from the traditional rhyme scheme of the villanelle.Sylvia Plaths ""Mad Girls Love Song"" puts a more contemporary spin on the form."
How to Write a Villanelle: Structure & Examples,Analyze the examples.,"Look critically at two villanelle examples. Use the examples to decide how to structure your villanelle.What will the tone of your villanelle be? More song-like and lyrical? Or more casual and direct? For example, Thomas ""Do Not Go Gentle Into that Good Night"" uses verbs like burn, rave, and rage and has a rhyming quality that flows when read out loud. In contrast, Plaths ""Mad Girls Love Song"" uses plainer language like shut, lift, and made up.Will your villanelle use a direct address? Plaths poem has an I speaker throughout the poem that addresses the reader. Thomas poem does not have an I speaker. Instead, the poem uses a you to suggest the poem is being told to another person, such as the speakers father.How will you use the refrain in each stanza of your villanelle? Will the refrains deepen the meaning of the previous lines? Contradict the meaning? In Thomas poem, the refrains reinforce the overall theme of the villanelle, urging the speakers father to rage, rage against the dying of the light. In Bishops ""One Art,"" Bishop rephrases the refrain lines. Rather than have freestanding phrases as refrain lines, Bishop uses line breaks to create refrains. ...to be lost that their loss is no disaster in the first stanza is then rephrased as None of these will bring disaster in the third stanza, and then is rephrased again in the fifth stanza as: I miss them but it wasnt a disaster."
How to Write a Villanelle: Structure & Examples,"Think about how to create an introduction, a section of development, and a conclusion in your villanelle.","This is the general pattern of the villanelle.[14] Bishops poem is a good example of an effective structure, as it begins with a claim: The art of losing isnt hard to master as its introduction.The poem then develops this claim or idea in the middle section, Lose something every day, I lost my mothers watch. The poem builds up to a conclusion by discussing bigger and bigger things the speaker loses, from her mothers watch to three loved houses to two cities to a continent.The conclusion in the last stanza then reveals the speaker also lost a you, a lover perhaps or a friend, and the speaker has to admit (Write it!"") that it is a disaster."
How to Write a Villanelle: Structure & Examples,Create an association diagram.,"An association diagram is also known as a clustering technique. You will create a cluster or group of words around a theme or idea.[15]Take out a sheet of paper. Write your main topic or subject in the middle of the paper. For example, a leopard.Moving out from the center, write down other words that pop into your mind that relate back to a leopard. You can also draw a circle or box around the main topic and use little lines to connect the other words to the main topic.For example, for a leopard, you might write predator, wild, jaws, spotted. Dont worry about organizing the words as you write. Simply let the words flow around the main topic.Once you feel you have written enough words around the main topic, start to cluster the words. Draw a circle around words that relate to each other and draw a line between the circled words to connect them. Continue doing this with the other words. Some of the terms may end up uncircled, but these lone words can still be useful.Focus on how the words relate back to the main topic. If you have clustered together several words that relate to predator, for example, maybe this may be a good approach for the poem. Or if there are a lot of clustered words that focus on teeth, this may be another way to approach a leopard.Answer questions like: I was surprised by or I discovered For example, you may look over the clustered words and note I was surprised by how often I mention my brother in relation to a leopard. Or, I discovered I may want to write about how a leopard means a wild or strong personality or character, like my brother."
How to Write a Villanelle: Structure & Examples,Do a freewrite.,"A freewrite is a chance for you to let your thoughts flow on a piece of paper. Write whatever comes into your mind and dont judge or worry about what you are writing.Take out a piece of paper, or open a new document on your computer. Write the main topic at the top of the paper. Then, set a time limit of 10 minutes and start the freewrite.[16]A good rule of thumb for the freewrite is to not lift your pen from the paper, or your fingers from the keyboard. This means not re-reading the sentences you just wrote or going back over a line for spelling, grammar, or punctuation. If you feel you have run out of things to write down, write about your frustrations about not having anything else to say about the main topic.Stop writing once the timer is up. Read over the text. Though there may be some confusing or convoluted thoughts, there will also be sentences you may like or an insight that may be useful.Highlight or underline sentences or phrases you think may work in the villanelle."
How to Write a Villanelle: Structure & Examples,Ask the six big questions.,"Take out a sheet of paper or open a new document. Write the main topic of the vignette on the top of the document. Then, write down six headings: Who? What? When? Where? Why? and How?[17]Respond to each question with a phrase or sentence. For example, if your topic is a leopard, you may answer Who? with my brother and I. You may answer When? with A hot summer day in July when I was six years old. You may answer Where? with the San Diego Zoo. You may answer Why? with Because my brother loved watching the leopard at the zoo and later became a strong personality as an adult. And you may answer How? with He grew up to be an angry man who is misunderstood by many people, including me.Look over your responses. Do you have more than one or two phrases for a certain question? Is there one question you had no answer for? If your answers reveal you know more about where and why, maybe this is where the strongest ideas for the villanelle are."
How to Write a Villanelle: Structure & Examples,Make two lists of words that rhyme.,"A key element of a villanelle is the rhyme scheme. Using the words and phrases you have written down in your brainstorm, create two lists of words that correspond with each other and rhyme. If you can think of phrases that end in rhyming words, write those down as well.Think about creating refrains that will help you build intensity in the poem. Avoid closed sentences that simply state the obvious, like We were at the zoo or I was six.For example, you may write down leopard and shepherd, or cage and age and rage.Or you may write down phrases like: the leopard paced around the cage and my brother and I didnt understand at that age.Think about creating detailed descriptions and detailed internal reflections or thoughts with the rhyming words in your list. Go for words that are easy to rhyme with, such as son, zoo, or age, rather than words that are very difficult to use in a rhyme, like orange.You can use a thesaurus to help you. You can purchase them from bookstores or find free ones online."
How to Write a Villanelle: Structure & Examples,Compose the first and second refrains.,"Once youve brainstormed and compiled a list of rhyming words or phrases, create the first and second refrains. These refrains should be meaningful to the poem, and should allow you to give them more meaning with each repetition.[18]To do this, you could place several rhyming words you like on two different lines and try to write sentences that work around these words. Remember that the refrains need to end with the rhyming words.You could also rearrange phrases you have written down to incorporate rhyming words at the end of the phrases. For example: In the cage, the leopard paced could be rephrased as: The leopard paced around the metal cage to then rhyme with My brother and I didnt understand at that age."
How to Write a Villanelle: Structure & Examples,Place the refrains in the structure of the villanelle.,"One of the easiest ways to work within the structure of the villanelle is to establish the refraining lines first and then work around them. On a piece of paper or a word-processing document, place the refrains within the form of the villanelle.They should appear as A1 and A2 in the order: A1 b A2 / a b A1 / a b A2 / a b A1 / a b A2 / a b A1 A2.So, if your first refrain is The leopard paced around the metal cage, and your second refrain is My brother and I didnt understand at that age, place them in the A1 and A2 lines of your villanelle."
How to Write a Villanelle: Structure & Examples,Create an introduction.,"Now that you have the refrains down, start filling in the first stanza. This is the introduction segment of the poem, so decide how you want to introduce your subject, theme, or idea to the reader.If you are describing a certain memory or moment, start by setting the scene. Such as: I was six when my brother and I saw a leopard at the San Diego Zoo.If you are writing the poem as a direct address to someone else, such as your brother, you could begin by discussing the last time you saw or spoke to this person. For example: You were dressed in black at the funeral. Or, you can use a line that doesnt use a you, similar to Dylan Thomas poem, such as: Dont become like the leopard, dont end up in a cage."
How to Write a Villanelle: Structure & Examples,Develop the middle section of the poem.,"The middle section should develop the subject, theme, or idea in the introduction. You have four stanzas to develop the poem and push the intensity of the poem.One way of building intensity is to have each stanza contain larger and larger moments. For example, in Bishops ""One Art,"" she goes from seemingly minor losses, like her mothers glasses, to the loss of houses, cities, and a continent. Think about the bigger or more absurd versions of your subject or theme. For a poem about a trip to the zoo, you could describe the other animals you saw at the zoo and then build intensity by describing the leopard in the fourth stanza. Or you could describe memories of your brother, moving from smaller moments of anger to larger moments of anger.Another way of building intensity is to have each stanza contain different descriptions of the subject or theme. In Thomas poem, the speaker discusses different descriptions of men in the middle stanzas, the Good men, the Wild men, and the Grave men. In each stanza, Thomas describes each type of mans approach to death or the dying of the light.[19]"
How to Write a Villanelle: Structure & Examples,Write a conclusion section.,"Maybe the most difficult section of a villanelle is the concluding section, or stanza. You will need to compose a meaningful ending that ties in the two refraining lines in a powerful way. Consider how you have built intensity in your villanelle so far. Dont be afraid to address the reader or a you in the last stanza. You can also home in on a specific phrase or image you feel is strong and meaningful.Is there a way you can complicate the beginning and middle section of the poem in the ending stanza? In Thomas villanelle, for example, the last stanza introduces the father character, as the speaker addresses a you. And you, my father, there on the sad height, / Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.The poem gives the reader different images of men in the middle section and the speaker is now considering what type of man his father is in the last stanza. By bringing in the you in the last stanza, Thomas makes the poem very personal and specific. It also makes the last stanza very powerful.The best last stanzas in a poem will leave the reader with more questions than answers. In Thomas poem, it is not clear if his father is a man who will go gentle into that good night. But the speaker in the poem asks the question and argues against his father succumbing to death. In a larger sense, the last stanza could also be seen as a plea to all fathers or men in the world to rage, rage against the dying of the light.The last stanza in Plaths villanelle takes a different approach than Thomas poem or Bishops poem. Rather than introduce a you, the speaker notes how the I was abandoned by a lover who did not return.But the refrain has a double meaning at the end of the poem, as the reader is not sure if in fact the speaker did make up the lover in her head or if the speaker just thinks she made up the lover in her head. The question of how mad the mad girl of the speaker is in the poem is left for the reader to decide.[20]"
How to Write a Villanelle: Structure & Examples,Read the villanelle out loud.,"Traditionally, villanelles were written to be read out loud. Continue this tradition by reading the villanelle in your own voice to yourself or to a friend.This will help you note if your rhyme scheme is off or if the rhythm of the lines of the poem flow well together.Revise and edit the villanelle as necessary until it almost has a song-like quality."

Then use a clean rag to rub the cleaning gel (and the dirt its collected) off of the leather.[3]If you prefer not to use a cleaning gel, you can also clean leather with a 1:1 mixture of white vinegar and water. An all-purpose saddle soap (bought at a feed and tack store) will also clean leather boots.[4]Depending on how dirty the boots were, you may need to use 2 or 3 rags to clean them."
How to Maintain Waterproof Leather Boots: 9 Steps (with Pictures),Rinse the boots and let them dry.,"Run the cleaned boots under a light stream of water from a garden hose or (if youre working indoors) bathroom sink or tub. You dont need to soak the boots, so turn off the water once youve rinsed all of the leather surfaces.[5]Let the boots sit for at least 24 hours to dry. If the weather is dry and sunny, place the boots outdoors to dry.To speed up the drying, stuff one or two sheets of newspaper into each boot. Newspaper helps absorb the moisture, drying your boots faster.Do not use a blow dryer to dry the boots, as it can cause the leather to crack."
How to Maintain Waterproof Leather Boots: 9 Steps (with Pictures),Rub conditioning oil into the boot leather.,"Conditioning oil should only be applied once the boots have fully dried. The consistency of this oil is like thick cream, so use your fingers to dip out a quarter-sized scoop of conditioning oil. Hold the boot from the inside using your other hand, and then rub the conditioning oil into the leather.[6]If you have logging or industrial leather boots, mink oil may also work, but be wary about using it on standard hiking boots. Mink oil may over-soften the dry-tanned leather used for many hiking boots.Conditioning boots will help keep the leather soft and supple. Leather that does not receive adequate conditioning may dry and become brittle over time."
How to Maintain Waterproof Leather Boots: 9 Steps (with Pictures),Avoid applying products with lanolin to your leather boots.,"Some types of leather product, like jackets or purses, benefit from the application of products containing lanolin, as lanolin naturally softens and moisturizes the leather.[7] If applied to boots, though, the lanolin could soften the leather too much.

Waterproof wax will seal the boot leather for many months."
How to Maintain Waterproof Leather Boots: 9 Steps (with Pictures),Consider a waterproof spray instead if youre in a hurry.,"Waterproof spray comes in an aerosol can and can be sprayed directly onto the boot leather. It can be applied more quickly than wax, so opt for a spray if you dont have much time to spend waterproofing your boots.[9] Waterproof sprays may not need to be rubbed into the leather at all. Consult the directions on the packaging.The disadvantage of waterproof sprays is that they do not soak into the leather as well as a wax. Consequently, a spray will need to be applied several times during the course of a single winter."
How to Maintain Waterproof Leather Boots: 9 Steps (with Pictures),Let the boots dry before wearing them.,"Whether you apply a waterproofing wax or a spray, youll need to give the leather time to absorb the chemicals and dry before wearing the boots. Air dry the boots until all of the wax has been absorbed and the leather is completely dry to the touch.[10]Place the boots in the path of a fan to speed up the drying process. The tongue should be propped open, and the fan should blow room temperature air on the boots.Never use a blow-dryer to dry the boots. The sudden application of heat can crack the leather."
3 Ways to Fix Compacted Soil - wikiHow,Discover the cause of compaction.,"Several obvious reasons cause soil compression, such as heavy machinery and foot traffic. Less obvious reasons include over-tilling the soil, leaving the soil bare to the rain, or working with wet soil. Knowing the reason for compaction helps you take precautions to limit it now and avoid it again in the future.[1]"
3 Ways to Fix Compacted Soil - wikiHow,Reroute traffic.,"Shift livestock, machinery, vehicle, and foot traffic away from the compacted area. Provide alternative routes and block off the area with barriers such as signs and fences. Do this long enough to give the area a rest and consider protecting the area permanently by keeping paths, roads, or stock runs to restrict traffic to one area.Try to designate already degraded soil for paths and household construction to limit the spread of compaction."
3 Ways to Fix Compacted Soil - wikiHow,Reduce cultivation.,"If you use the compacted area for farming or gardening, move your plants somewhere else for at least one growing cycle. Instead, try substituting a cover crop at the end of the season, such as winter wheat or ryegrass. The roots break up the soil, and then next season you can mow and turn it in the soil with a spade or tiller to further aerate.[2]A light, non-machine compaction can often be cured by letting the soil freeze and thaw through one growing cycle.Tillage radishes can help with severe compaction with their large roots, which work deep into the soil and leave space after they decay."
3 Ways to Fix Compacted Soil - wikiHow,Punch holes with a garden fork.,"For small, grassy areas, a small metal garden fork or sandals with spikes in the bottoms are enough to poke holes in the soil. Aeration holes let in air, water, and roots. Start on one side of the lawn and push the fork into the ground in one direction every few inches or eight to ten centimeters.[3]You may need to repeat the process in a different direction to achieve aeration."
3 Ways to Fix Compacted Soil - wikiHow,Dig up compaction.,"Loosen the compaction by digging up two or three inches of dirt with a shovel. Take a spade and divide the soil into small rows about a foot wide. Dig small trenches behind these rows, then use the rows of soil to replace the dirt removed from the trenches.[4]For poor soil, you may need to dig deeper, about two spade-lengths, to help aerate the top layer and mix it with better soil."
3 Ways to Fix Compacted Soil - wikiHow,Get a rototiller with an aeration attachment.,"Buy or rent a rototiller from a lawn and garden or home improvement store and consider getting an aeration attachment for it. Run the tiller over the soil, then run it over again two or three times, using it to cut deeper.[5]Tillers arent as effective on large areas as coring machines since they only break up the top layer of soil.Tilling too regularly actually contributes to soil compaction, because it creates a hard pan of soil below the tilled area."
3 Ways to Fix Compacted Soil - wikiHow,Remove soil cores.,"Plug aerators are heavy machines that are useful for large areas of foot traffic such as lawns or fields. Rent the machine from a home and garden store, then set the machine against moist soil. As it rolls across the soil it will pull out a core of dirt, then move it two or three inches away. Repeat throughout the area. Let the removed soil plugs dry before breaking and scattering them.[6]Badly compacted areas require multiple passes of the aerating machine.Mark off any areas where pipes and roots run close to the surface. The aeration plugs should only be a couple of inches deep, but it can still damage these structures.There are also hand held aerators which you push into the soil manually and then move, which may be better for smaller lawns or gardens."
3 Ways to Fix Compacted Soil - wikiHow,Replace the soil.,"This is an intensive solution and is mostly used for small areas to reintroduce grass. Dig up the compacted soil by hand or by machine. You can gather the soil into a planting mound nearby or bury it in good soil. Bring in new topsoil and spread it over the area.Check with your lawn and garden or home improvement store for a soil that has the qualities to nurture plant growth.[7]The larger the plant, the more replacement soil it will need to flourish. Trees and shrubs require 15 inches to three feet of replacement soil."
3 Ways to Fix Compacted Soil - wikiHow,Let soil dry before use.,"A particular time of danger is when gardeners go out to plant in the spring. You will be eager to go out and work, but immediately after rain, the soil is too wet. Working with soil when it is too wet causes it to lose structure and collapse in on itself. Instead, wait until the soil is dry and crumbly. To test for soil ready to be worked, form a ball of soil in your hand. The soil should break apart when worked and when dropped."
3 Ways to Fix Compacted Soil - wikiHow,Avoid overworking the soil.,"Aerating is beneficial for soil, but tilling it too often keeps the soil from settling. Good soil forms small clumps after being tilled once. These clumps are the pockets that give the soil the structure that permits air and water to penetrate it. It can be tempting to till the soil again and again, but this collapses the soil. Till the soil only before planting and during occasional aeration.Even consider trying no-till gardening or farming. Some studies have shown no-till farming reduces compaction and increases soil productivity as compared to tilling.[8]"
3 Ways to Fix Compacted Soil - wikiHow,Work in organic material.,"While you aerate the soil, add compost or mulch. Yard waste, wood chips, or even food scraps are a cheap option that can be added to lawns, gardens, and even around trees to refresh the soil. Make compost or buy it at a lawn and garden store. The organics are broken down by organisms such as earthworms that aerate the soil.For badly compacted soil, add a 50% compost blend to regular soil and 25% in sandier soils.[9]Avoid amending soil with inorganic material such as sand if possible. Too little sand worsens the compaction."
3 Ways to Fix Compacted Soil - wikiHow,Limit traffic pressure.,"Pressure against the soil is a common way to compress it. Avoid riding lawn mowers and use vehicles with wider tires, adjusted air pressure in tires, and less weight on axles. During construction, limit vehicles to areas where the soil will be covered such as by paths or patios. Also, covering the soil with mulch and -inch thick plywood or synthetic substitutes help reduce the pressure on the soil when traffic cannot be avoided.[10]"

How to Help a Cat Give Birth (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Take her for a check-up.,"Once you know your cat is pregnant (or if you suspect that she may be), take her to a licensed veterinarian for a medical check-up.The vet can verify that the pregnancy is advancing without complications and can advise you on how to prepare for the birth of the kittens.It's particularly important to take a cat who is overweight or has pre-existing health problems to see a vet as soon as you're aware of or suspect pregnancy, as she will be more at risk for complications.[2]In some instances, the vet may determine that continuing the pregnancy could endanger the mother and that spaying her at this stage is the best and most humane way to proceed.The vet can also estimate how many kittens to expect, which will be useful later to determine when all of the kittens have been delivered and labor should be over.[3]"
How to Help a Cat Give Birth (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Adjust her diet in the third trimester.,"When a pregnant cat reaches her third trimester (approximately 42 days into the pregnancy or when her belly is visibly swollen), she will have different nutritional needs, so be sure to make sure she's getting the proper amount of food and nutrients.[4]Keep her on her usual diet for the first two thirds of the pregnancy.For the final trimester, switch her to kitten food, which is higher in calories for a smaller volume of food.

Your cat will usually display nesting signs several days before the birth is imminent, and this is the perfect opportunity to direct her to the nest that you have already prepared for her.The laundry room or a bathroom are great places to set up a nest for her; just ensure that no kids or dogs are rushing through this spot at any time. The mother must feel safe and relaxed in her nesting area.She should have easy access to fresh water, a little bit of food, and the litter box (which should be about two feet away - putting it too close can increase the chance of disease).Find a large cardboard box with high sides and fill it with old, soft things you won't mind getting soiled, like towels, fluffy blankets, newspapers, etc.Whatever material you decide on, it shouldn't have any strong scents, since the mother and kittens recognize each other by smell."

Use a nail brush or an old toothbrush to get under your fingernails.Do not use hand sanitizer! It doesn't do a thorough job of killing all the germs, and you do not want the queen licking the ingredients in hand sanitizer off the kittens, as it could make her sick.Hand washing is precautionary and the queen should be allowed to take care of the birthing process and kittens on her own. Only intervene if a kitten is in distress, and then return the kitten as soon as possible."
How to Help a Cat Give Birth (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Keep an eye on each delivery.,"Once the mother enters her nesting box and labor commences, the best thing you can do is to keep calm, be prepared, and keep watch over the deliveries. Be sure to keep both yourself and the environment around her calm. If there are any disturbances or animals around, or if she is moved to a strange place, she will delay labor. When the next stage of birth, Stage 2, is about to begin, it will typically develop as follows:[11]The cervix starts to relax and the queen begins uterine contractions.There's a build-up in contractions as the first kitten enters the birth canal. Contractions should be at 2 - 3 minute intervals and the mother will probably be in a crouched position. She may cry out and pant.The amniotic fluid (water bubble) comes through first, followed by the kitten (either head first or rear paws first).Once Stage 2 of the labor commences, it will last about 30 minutes to an hour and then the first kitten should be born. Each subsequent kitten will be about half an hour apart, sometimes up to an hour.If your cat has settled down and has been pushing hard without a kitten emerging for longer than an hour, it's likely a sign of a problem. Look to see if there is anything at the vulva lips. If there is nothing, then it's best to contact the vet. If a kitten is partially out, let her push for another 5 minutes. If she has made no progress, wash your hands, and gently grasp the part of the kitten you can see and pull gently - preferably in time to the queen's contractions. If the kitten does not slide out easily, contact the vet.[12]"
How to Help a Cat Give Birth (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Ensure that the mother removes the amniotic sac and cleans each kitten.,"The mother usually removes the membrane of the amniotic sac by vigorously licking the kitten. The kitten should be breathing and moving within seconds as a result.[13]If she doesn't remove the amniotic sac quickly, break the membrane around the kitten's face with your sterilized, gloved hands to ensure that the kitten can breathe. Wipe the face clean with a clean and dry towel.Where possible give the kitten straight back to mom, and if necessary place the kitten under her nose. She will then usually lick the kitten. If however, mom ignores the kitten and it remains wet and starts to shiver, dry the kitten yourself by rubbing it vigorously with a clean, dry towel. This has the dual effect of making the kitten cry, which attracts the mother's attention and kindles her interest. At this point put the kitten back with its mother."
How to Help a Cat Give Birth (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Check for the placenta.,"There is one placenta per kitten, and it should be expelled after the birth of each. Note each placenta because a placenta that is left inside a mother could become infected and result in the death of the mother unless you seek medical attention.DO NOT ATTEMPT TO PULL OUT A PLACENTA. If you tug on the umbilical cord and it causes the uterus to rip, the mother could die. If you suspect that a placenta hasn't been expelled, take her to your vet.Note that the mother normally eats the placenta. It is full of hormones and nutrients that need to be returned to her body, so do not interfere in this process - just be sure she doesn't try to eat the kitten with it out of lack of experience.You may want to let her eat the first two or three placentas and then take away the rest, as too many of the nutrients can cause diarrhea or vomiting."
How to Help a Cat Give Birth (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Do not cut the umbilical cord.,"It is generally advised that you do NOT cut the umbilical cords of the placentas. Most mothers will chew off the cord themselves. If they don't, consult your vet.[14]Do not cut the cord if part of it is still inside the mother. Because the cord is attached to the placenta, the placenta may get trapped inside her and not be expelled, which will result in an infection and the death of the mother. Rather than try to intervene yourself, call your vet and follow his or her directions.The latest advice is to gently wash the kitten's navel with a diluted disinfectant such as chlorhexidine. Vets are seeing more cases of peritonitis associated with a specific bacteria invading the umbilical cord at birth, and simple disinfecting with a suitable agent prevents this problem. Try not to distress the queen by removing the kittens. Have the disinfectant ready on cotton wool and gently dab the navels whilst the kitten is in her sight. Do not distress the mother. If she strongly objects to your interference then leave things be rather than risk rejection of the kittens."
How to Help a Cat Give Birth (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Make sure that the kittens nurse as soon as possible.,"The early milk contains valuable colostrum with antibodies for the kittens.Be aware that kittens are both blind and deaf when they are born, so they will be seeking out the mother's nipples by smell and touch. Sometimes they do so right away, and sometimes they wait several minutes while they recover from birth.The mother may wait until all of the kittens are born before allowing them to suckle. However, if the mother appears to reject the kittens and refuses to allow them to nurse, prepare the milk-powder you purchased and feed the kittens yourself using a kitten-fostering bottle.[15]If the mother is allowing the kittens to nurse but there's a problem with the milk coming in, you may see the kittens attempting to suckle and meowing instead. If no milk seems to flow, see the vet, who may be able to stimulate it, and in the meantime feed the kittens the milk-powder using a kitten-fostering bottle.[16]"
How to Help a Cat Give Birth (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Look after the kittens' health.,"After the kittens are born, keep an eye on them to make sure they're adjusting and settling in normally.If a kitten makes choking or gurgling sounds, it has fluid in its air passages. Hold the kitten between your hands with the head on your fingertips (think of making a sling from your hands). Gently swing the kitten downward. This will help to force the fluids out of the kitten's lungs. Use a gauze pad to wipe its face. Be sure to use gloves, but be careful, as a newborn kitten is very slippery.If the mother cat appears disinterested in her kittens, try rubbing her scent onto them. If she persists in not being interested, you may have to care for the kittens yourself. This will involve constant feeding and an incubator. It is too involved to explain as part of this article, so seek your vet's advice.Don't be alarmed if one of the kittens is stillborn (dead). Make sure he or she is really dead, though, before disposing of him or her appropriately. Try to revive a limp kitten by rubbing him or her briskly to stimulate him or her. Use a warm, damp facecloth to rub with. Other things you can try include raising and lowering his or her legs and blowing into his or her face and mouth."
How to Help a Cat Give Birth (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Look after the mother's health.,"Keep plenty of good quality food and fresh water immediately next to the nest after the birthing has ended. She won't want to leave her kittens, even to eat or use the litter box, so keeping them as near as possible will allow her to take care of her needs while still remaining near her kittens. It's particularly important that she eat so that she can keep up her own energy and pass on nutrients to the nursing litter.Try to put the food close by, but keep it separate from the litter tray. Cats dislike toileting near where they eat, so whilst she won't want to leave the kittens, she may be put off from eating if the tray is also too close.For the first day or so, she may not get up at all; keep the food near her bed if possible.Check on her to be sure she's recovering well from the birth and is bonding with and caring for the kittens."

How to Do Undercut Hair for Women: 11 Steps (with Pictures),Trim the hair with the clippers to your desired length.,"Once youve chosen the appropriate blade for your clippers, run them over the section of hair that you want to cut in an upward direction to just below the headband to remove it.

How to Do Undercut Hair for Women: 11 Steps (with Pictures),Switch to a shorter blade to finish the cut.,"After youve removed the bulk of your hair, you may find that its not quite as short as youd like. Swap the blade on your clippers for the next smallest size, and go over the hair a second time to finish it off.[13]Dont panic if you wind up cutting your hair a little too short.

3 Ways to Interpret an Astrological Birth Chart - wikiHow,Devise a short sentence describing the interconnectedness of your signs.,"A good way to grasp the comprehensive nature of your Primal Triad is to sum it up in a declarative statement that says something about how each sign expresses itself in your being. Yours might look something like this: I am a Taurus with the heart of a Gemini that the world sees as a Cancer. Put in the down-to-earth language of classical archetypes, you might sum yourself up as, a sensualist with the heart of a storyteller that the world sees as a nurturer.""[8]You could also try describing yourself using traits associated with each of your signs: ""I am peaceful, contemplative person with a courageous heart that the world sees as generous and sincere.""This exercise can also be useful for helping you better understand your friends and loved ones."

The elements underlying the signs that make up a person's Primal Triad can offer further insight into the nuances of their character.[11]Fire signs, for instance, are often characterized by passion, excitement, creativity, and impulsiveness, while air signs are celebrated as intellectual, communicative, and social-minded.Relying on the elements alone can be misleading, so don't read too far into these classifications. They're just one piece of a complex puzzle."

In the case of a Taurus moon, these might include ""emotionally stable"" under Thoughts and Communication, ""faithful"" and ""possessive"" under Love and Relationships, and ""industrious"" and ""uncompromising"" under Strengths and Weaknesses.In other words, youre contemplating the natures your subject's various signs, elements, and modalities and using your observations to theorize about what effect they might be having on their dealings with themselves and others."
3 Ways to Interpret an Astrological Birth Chart - wikiHow,Identify your subjects dominant traits by looking for meaningful repetitions.,"A sun-in-Aries, sun-square-mars, stellium-in-Leo, and sun-conjunct-midheaven can all suggest a quick temper and a tendency towards self-centeredness. If youre seeing the same characteristics over and over while reviewing your subjects birth chart, theres a good chance that youve discovered a dominant trait in their psyche.[14]A persons ruling planet (also known as their chart ruler) can also provide a major clue as to what theyre like and how they interact with the world. An Aries (which is ruled over by the fierce planet mars) will probably be aggressive, and competitive, even if their moon and ascendant signs offer a bit of a counterbalance.[15]Even traits that only appear once or twice can potentially be quite pronounced if they have a very close aspect, or their associated planet has a strong influence over the subject (as in the case of ruling, personalized, and dignified planets)."

3 Ways to Interpret an Astrological Birth Chart - wikiHow,Discuss your interpretation with your subject.,"Take the time to answer questions, offer alternative theories, or clear up any confusion that the person might have. The intricacies of a birth chart can be a lot to take in at once, so be patient and do your best to break down your findings in a way that makes sense to the person given their individual depth of knowledge about the practice of astrology.[17]If your subject asks you a question that doesn't have a clear answer, don't be tempted to make something up in order to save face or put them at ease. Instead, remind them that while astrology is a wonderful tool for gaining knowledge of self and other, it can't predict the future or right wrongs miraculously.[18]When youre done, print out a copy of your report for your subject to take with them, or email them the document you put together during your meeting."

If you can slowly detach from this person, theyll eventually look elsewhere for what they want. Whenever theres a chance to hang out, find something else to do. If you may run into them with mutual friends, spend the night at home.[4]If they do poke around and ask why youre avoiding them, you can simply play coy like you dont really know what theyre talking about, or you can apologize and say you wont do it again (but definitely do it again)."

If you want to keep this person around (or you cant avoid them) but you want to curb their behavior, simply draw a line in the sand for them.[5] For each boundary:Explain where the line is. Do not mince words when you tell them what you will no longer accept. For example, You cannot tell me how to spend my time and money.Describe the consequence. There must be a clear consequence or else they will keep at it. You could say, If you dont stop, Im not going to talk to you about what Im up to.Refuse to back down. Manipulative people tend to push back on boundaries. Dont let up. You might say, Its not up for negotiation. Im not asking; Im telling. Thats it.Enforce the boundary.

How to Get Rid of a Narcissist: Proven & Effective Solutions,"If youre not worth spending your time on, they will get tuckered out.","Some people like to push your buttons to get a reaction out of you, but if you refuse to give an emotional reaction, theyll learn to leave you alone. This is known as the gray rock strategy. Basically, become as interesting as a boring, old rock youd find laying by the side of the road. Only respond in writing, if possible, dont smile at them, keep a straight face when they tell a joke, and dont hesitate to grunt or throw a hmm out there when they talk to you.[7]The trick here is to be really muted, indescriptive, and detached. If this person isnt getting a whole lot out of you, theyll become frustrated and start spending their time elsewhere."
How to Get Rid of a Narcissist: Proven & Effective Solutions,Youll get zero mileage out of curt back-talk or frustration.,"When it comes to interacting with a manipulative person, they usually want to draw you into verbal combat. If theyre bothering you, just keep it super friendly and dont let them get to you. By not meeting them on their level, youll keep them from feeling vindicated which can get them to let you be.[8]Its sort of like dealing with a bully. A bully will try to get you to beg, plead, or throw a punch. By responding in a friendly way, youll throw them off their game.For example, if they say, I cant believe youre so late. Youre such a slob when it comes to keeping track of time, you might say, Yeah, sorry. Totally my bad!"

The happier you are about being you, the less likely this person will be to bother you.[9]This isnt to say that you automatically feel bad about who you are if someone toxic is hovering around you. Its not your fault that this person is being abusive."
How to Get Rid of a Narcissist: Proven & Effective Solutions,"If they have a habit of gaslighting, practice trusting your instincts.","Gaslighting is when someone tries to trick another person into doubting their reality. If this person is showering you with criticism and negativity, you may start thinking that youve got a problem. You dont. Push their critiques out of your mind and dont let them keep you up at night. Youre doing nothing wrong by trying to remove them from your life.[10]If you do need help parsing out whether youve made a mistake or not, talk to a close friend or family member whom you trust to get some feedback.If youre tempted to go back, remind yourself why you left in the first place. You might make a list of everything theyve done to you, or put a note up in your room to remind yourself to stay the course.[11]"

People like this often thrive on conflict, and provoking them will only make you all that more interesting to them.[12]If you suspect they could become physically aggressive, calling them out may even be a dangerous move if you push their buttons too hard.[13]"

How to Treat Respiratory Problems in Bulldogs: 10 Steps,Keep an eye on your dog's breathing.,"If you have a bulldog you should always be on the look out for signs of breathing distress. If you notice labored breathing early, it can help your dog avoid the discomfort of severe breathing difficulty.[3]If you are walking your dog, continually assess how the dog is breathing and if it is having difficulty.Signs of breathing difficulty include excessive wheezing, panting, and, in extreme cases, passing out."
How to Treat Respiratory Problems in Bulldogs: 10 Steps,Give your dog lots of rest.,"Do not over exercise a dog that has difficulty breathing. While we all want our dogs to get plenty of exercise to stay healthy, the health of a dog with respiratory problems can actually be put at risk when forced into extreme exercise.Once breathing becomes labored, you need to allow the dog to recover its breathe.If the dog is breathing very hard, do not ask the dog to walk to a shady spot or cool room. Instead, pick it up and carry it.Under normal conditions, your dog should recover its breath in a few minutes. However, if it is hot or your dog has a severe respiratory issue, it may take the dog longer to recover."
How to Treat Respiratory Problems in Bulldogs: 10 Steps,Cool the dog down.,"If your dog is overheated and having respiratory problems, you need to cool the dog down. If breathing becomes exaggerated, immediately let it rest in a cool place.You should also offer it cool water to drink. This can help to cool the dog down on the inside."
How to Treat Respiratory Problems in Bulldogs: 10 Steps,Be prepared to take your dog to a veterinarian.,"If your dog's breathing does not improve rapidly, phone your vet. Tell them you have a possible emergency. Be prepared to tell the veterinarian about your dog's symptoms and how long they have been going on.Keep the dog calm, quiet, and cool on the way to the clinic."
How to Treat Respiratory Problems in Bulldogs: 10 Steps,Get emergency veterinary treatment for a dog having labored breathing.,"The vet can give cool intravenous fluids if the dog is overheated. The vet can also put it in an oxygen tent to aid its breathing. In addition, drugs such as corticosteroids can relieve swelling at the back of the throat, that has arisen as a result of increased breathing efforts.However, if the dog's problems are severe enough to warrant emergency treatment then corrective surgery once the dog is stable, should be considered."
How to Treat Respiratory Problems in Bulldogs: 10 Steps,Consider surgical correction of BAOS.,"Depending on the extent and type of problem you bulldog has, it may be able to be corrected. This is especially true if the dog is young, as it will recover from surgery more easily. Your vet may consider the following options in order to improve your bulldog's breathing:[4][5]Nostril surgery: Corrective surgery means removing a cake-slice of flesh from the nostrils with the intent of making the nostrils wider to facilitate breathing through the nose.Soft palate surgery: Trimming away the excess length of soft palate means the back of the throat is clearer and the windpipe less likely to become plugged with the palate from time to time.Laryngeal saccules removal: Specialist surgeons can remove the laryngeal saccules, hence removing another obstruction from the back of the throat.Unfortunately, there is no surgery that can fix a relatively oversized tongue or the small diameter of the windpipe."
How to Treat Respiratory Problems in Bulldogs: 10 Steps,Give post-operative care.,"Dogs that go through surgery and anesthesia may have a hard recovery. Your dog may be groggy and lethargic for quite awhile. Overall, make sure your dog is gradually recovering and follow all directions that come from your veterinary surgeon. Keep an eye on your dog for signs that it is having difficulty breathing. If it is, call the veterinarian and take the bulldog in for treatment.Even after surgery your dog may have difficulty breathing in extreme conditions. Take sensible precautions, such as not over-exerting your dog in the heat. Also, use a harness rather than a collar, as this puts less pressure on the windpipe, making it easier to breathe."
How to Treat Respiratory Problems in Bulldogs: 10 Steps,Look for labored breathing at rest.,"Think of a normal dog and usually at rest they breathe steadily and silently through their nose, with no panting involved. Now consider the bulldog at rest, who is likely to pant with an open mouth, snort, and breathe so loudly you can hear it from the next room.This is not just a cute attribute of the bulldog but indicates a compromised respiratory tract."
How to Treat Respiratory Problems in Bulldogs: 10 Steps,Pay attention to the dog's behavior while active.,"When more demands are placed on its respiratory system, such as during exercise or hot weather, the signs of BAOS are exaggerated. These include:[6]Excessive heavy panting: The dog will pant a lot, with a tongue that becomes very dry and strings of sticky saliva hanging from its lips.Reluctance to move: The dog stubbornly refuses to move because to do so requires extra oxygen that it does not have.Choking or snoring sounds: Typically these sounds are made as a result of the soft palate being sucked into the windpipe.Pale or blue-tinged gums: A warning sign that the dog is distressed is that the normally pink membranes of its mouth look pale or blue-tinged.Collapse: If the dog cannot get in enough oxygen it will collapse and faint."
How to Treat Respiratory Problems in Bulldogs: 10 Steps,Assess whether your bulldog has the physical attributes that could bring on BAOS.,"This will signal that you should be on the look out for symptoms. The significant components of BAOS include:[7]Narrow nostrils: This makes it difficult for the bulldog to breathe in through its noseForeshortened nose: This means the bony scrolls (or turbinates) inside the nose are compressed into a smaller space.Large tongue: Although bony structures, such as the nose, are shortened, the tongue is a regular size. Thus the tongue takes up too much room inside the mouth and blocks the back of the throat.Overlong soft palate: The flap of flesh at the back of the throat that separates the nose from the mouth, and prevents food going down the windpipe, is too long relative to the size of the nose. This means yet more tissue occupying the back of throat, and its location makes it prone to being sucked into the windpipe and making choking noises.Everted laryngeal saccules: Glandular tissue at the back of the throat (equivalent to tonsils) gets sucked out of the area they should sit in. This leads to them intruding into the airway and further cutting down on the ability to breathe.Hypoplastic windpipe: Unfortunately, selectively breeding for a flat face led to selection of dogs that also have an unnaturally narrow windpipe. This means the tube connected to the lungs is too narrow, adding another layer of difficulty to breathing."
How to Protect a Marble Countertop: 12 Steps (with Pictures),Buy an acid-resistant impregnator sealer.,"There are many different counter sealers out there to choose from. However, depending on the ingredients, some will be effective and others may cause damage. Read the label carefully and make sure to go with a sealer that is an acid-resistant impregnator.

Afterwards, dry the area thoroughly with a clean, dry cloth.[1]Dont clean your countertop with any harsh or acidic chemicals or products, such as bleach or lemon juice."
How to Protect a Marble Countertop: 12 Steps (with Pictures),Read the instructions on the sealers label.,"Before applying the sealer, its important to read and understand the manufacturers directions on how to do so. Different manufacturers require using different application techniques and amounts of sealer, depending on the type of stone as well as the type of finish."
How to Protect a Marble Countertop: 12 Steps (with Pictures),Apply the sealer by spraying and rubbing it in.,"Begin following the sealers directions. Typically, the sealer label will instruct you to spray the entirety of your countertop with the sealer and then rub it in with a clean, soft cloth.If youve never sealed you countertop before with the product youre using, consider treating a small area and checking it 24 hours later to make sure it had a positive effect on your countertop.If your countertop has a large surface area, you may want to treat small sections one at a time."
How to Protect a Marble Countertop: 12 Steps (with Pictures),Wait 5 minutes and remove any excess sealer.,"Unless otherwise instructed, let the sealer soak in for about 5 minutes and then get a clean microfiber cloth to use to wipe up any excess. If you happened to apply the perfect amount of sealer, then there may not be any left for you to remove. If this is the case, do a quick counter wipe with the microfiber cloth anyway."
How to Protect a Marble Countertop: 12 Steps (with Pictures),Apply a second coat after 15 minutes.,"Its common and often beneficial to do more than one coat when applying sealer, mostly because multiple coats ensure full coverage. Make sure to wait at least 15 minutes so that the first coat can completely soak in, and then apply additional coats as needed and/or specified in your sealers directions."
How to Protect a Marble Countertop: 12 Steps (with Pictures),Seal your countertop once a month.,"In order to provide the best possible protection for your countertop, youll need to repeat this process about once a month. Your marble countertop can stain easily and quickly, but with a strong sealer always on it, youll have a little more time to clean up any spills and prevent staining or etching.[2]"
How to Protect a Marble Countertop: 12 Steps (with Pictures),Wipe up spills immediately.,"If you want to keep your marble countertop in pristine condition, its vital that you wipe up any spills as soon as they happen. Marble is especially sensitive to acidic substances such as coffee, soda, fruit juices, and many common cleaning products. As soon as a liquid comes in contact with your counter, wipe it up with a paper towel, sponge, or soft cloth.[3]Keep a hand towel nearby to ensure quick clean up."
How to Protect a Marble Countertop: 12 Steps (with Pictures),Remove stains right away.,"If you wipe up a spill and it has already created a stain, remove the stain right then and there. Different kinds of stains require different removal techniques. Make sure you remove the stain quickly and properly.Remove an oil-based stain with a soft liquid cleanser, liquid detergent, ammonia, or mineral spirits.Remove an organic stain with a mixture of 12% hydrogen peroxide and a few drops of ammonia.Remove water stains with dry steel wool.[4]"
How to Protect a Marble Countertop: 12 Steps (with Pictures),"Use cutting boards, coasters, placemats, and trivets.","All of these items create a barrier between your countertop and potentially damaging substances. This will prevent etches, scratches, and burn marks from permanently scarring your marble countertop.[5]"
How to Protect a Marble Countertop: 12 Steps (with Pictures),Apply a poultice to your countertop.,"If your marble countertop is looking especially dirty, dull, or stained, it might be best to apply a paste-like cleaning agent, such as baking soda, to your entire countertop. Mix the paste and slather it onto the counter evenly with a spatula so that its  to  inch (0.64-1.27cm) thick. Cover it with plastic wrap and tape down the edges with painters tape. Remove the plastic after 24-48 hours, let the paste dry out, and then remove it with a wooden or plastic scraper.[6]"

"Heal Cervicitis: Causes, Symptoms, Treatment, & More",Be aware of the symptoms of cervicitis.,"In some women, cervicitis produces no symptoms; you may not realize you have it until a doctor notices a problem during a routine gynaecological exam. However, many women do notice symptoms. These include:[2]Abnormal vaginal discharge that has an odor or is a gray or yellow color.Spotting between menstrual periods or after sexual intercourse.A feeling of heaviness in the lower abdomen, especially during sex.A burning or itchy sensation when you urinate."
"Heal Cervicitis: Causes, Symptoms, Treatment, & More",Allow your doctor to perform a pelvic exam.,"The symptoms of cervicitis can easily be confused with the symptoms of other conditions, so do not attempt to diagnose cervicitis yourself. Consult your primary care physician or gynecologist if you suspect you may have cervicitis. If your doctor suspects cervicitis, she will perform a standard pelvic exam, using a speculum to examine your cervix.[3]If your pelvic exam reveals cervicitis, your doctor will order the appropriate laboratory tests to confirm the cervicitis and determine its cause. These tests may include a culture of your cervical discharge, a culture of the cervical cells themselves, blood tests, and, if you are sexually active, tests for sexually transmitted infections, including gonorrhoea and chlamydia."
"Heal Cervicitis: Causes, Symptoms, Treatment, & More",Determine the cause of the cervicitis.,"With the right tests, your doctor should be able to identify the cause of your cervicitis. There are two different kinds of cervicitis: infectious (also known as acute) and noninfectious (also known as chronic). Infectious cervicitis and noninfectious cervicitis have different possible causes and therefore require different treatment regimens.[4]Infectious cervicitis is typically caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as  gonorrhoea or chlamydia. It is usually treated with antibiotic medication.Noninfectious cervicitis can be caused by a number of things, including foreign objects, such as intrauterine devices and cervical caps, an allergic reaction to latex due to sexual intercourse with latex condoms, and douches, vaginal washes, and other products that can irritate the vagina and cervix. It is usually treated with antibiotics and with removal of the offending agent."
"Heal Cervicitis: Causes, Symptoms, Treatment, & More",Take the prescribed antibiotics for an STI.,"If you have infectious cervicitis caused by a sexually transmitted disease like gonorrhoea, chlamydia, or syphilis, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection.[5]If you have gonorrhoea, your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic called Ceftriaxone, which can be administered in a single injection of 250 milligrams.[6] In complicated or advanced infections, you may need stronger doses and/or additional oral antibiotics. Your doctor may also prescribe Azithromycin or Doxycycline, which are used to treat chlamydia. This step is taken because patients are often infected with both STIs.[7]If you have chlamydia, your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic called Azithromycin, which can be taken in a single oral dose of 1 gram.[8] Alternatively, she may prescribe Erythromycin, Doxycycline, or Ofloxacin; these drugs are typically taken for seven days. Additionally, your doctor will prescribe Ceftriaxone to treat gonorrhoea, as the two infections often co-exist.[9]If you have trichomoniasis, your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic called Metronidazole, which can be administered in a single dose.[10]If you have syphilis, your doctor will prescribe penicillin. A one-time dose should be sufficient to cure syphilis in its early stages, when the infection is less than one year old. For more advanced cases, you may also need additional injections or other treatments. If you are allergic to penicillin, your doctor will prescribe Azithromycin.[11]"
"Heal Cervicitis: Causes, Symptoms, Treatment, & More",Take antiviral medications as prescribed.,"If you have infectious cervicitis caused by a virus, such as genital herpes, your doctor will prescribe antiviral medications to treat the virus.[12]If you have genital herpes, your doctor will prescribe the antiviral drug Acyclovir, which is taken for five days. Alternatively, she may prescribe Valacyclovir or Famciclovir, used for three days and one day, respectively. If you have a severe or complicated case, you may need additional treatments and/or increased dosages. Keep in mind genital herpes is a chronic, lifelong infection and you will need to treat the disease continually once you contract it.[13]"
"Heal Cervicitis: Causes, Symptoms, Treatment, & More",Make sure your sexual partners are treated.,"If you are treated for an STI, all of your partners need to be tested and treated, too. Sexually transmitted infections can be present in men and women without producing any symptoms at all, and untreated carriers of STIs can easily re-infect you in the future. Make sure all your previous sexual partners see a doctor.[14]"
"Heal Cervicitis: Causes, Symptoms, Treatment, & More",Follow your doctors instructions and take your medication properly.,"Its important that you also tell your doctor if you are pregnant (or may possibly become pregnant), breastfeeding, or dealing with any other health issues before you are prescribed any medication. Contact your doctor if you have adverse reactions to your medication, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and rashes.Cervicitis can become a serious, long term problem if it is not treated with the right medication and given time to heal properly. With the right medication and treatment, you can make a full recovery from cervicitis. However, if you have genital herpes, you will need to commit to lifelong management of this chronic infection."
"Heal Cervicitis: Causes, Symptoms, Treatment, & More",Consider cryosurgery.,"If you have persistent non-infectious cervicitis, you may need to address the problem surgically with cryosurgery, also called freeze therapy.[15]Cryosurgery involves the use of extreme cold to destroy abnormal tissue. A cryoprobe, which is an instrument that contains liquid nitrogen, is inserted into the vagina. The cold compressed nitrogen makes the metal instrument cold enough to destroy the diseased tissues. Freezing is done for three minutes. The cervix is then allowed to thaw, and freezing is repeated for another three minutes.Cryosurgery is relatively painless, but you may experience cramping, bleeding, and, in more serious cases, infection and scarring. For two to three weeks after your surgery, you can expect to notice a watery discharge. This is caused by the shedding of dead cervical tissue."
"Heal Cervicitis: Causes, Symptoms, Treatment, & More",Talk to your doctor about cauterization.,"Another possible surgical treatment for persistent non-infectious cervicitis is cauterization, also called heat therapy.Cauterization is an outpatient procedure that burns away the inflamed or infected cells. You will lie on your back with your legs in stirrups, and a speculum will be inserted into the vagina to hold it open. The cervix is then cleansed using a vaginal swab, and a heated probe is used to destroy the diseased tissues.Anesthesia may be used to prevent discomfort before cauterization. You may experience cramping, bleeding, and watery discharge for up to four weeks. Call your doctor, however, if the discharge has an offensive smell, or if the bleeding is heavy."
"Heal Cervicitis: Causes, Symptoms, Treatment, & More",Ask your doctor about laser therapy.,"A third possible surgical treatment for persistent non-infectious cervicitis is laser therapy.[16]Laser therapy is typically done in an operating room under general anesthesia and involves the use of an intense laser beam/light to burn/destroy abnormal tissues. A speculum is inserted into the vagina to hold it open. The laser beam is directed toward any abnormal tissue.Anesthesia will limit your discomfort during the procedure. Afterward, you may notice cramping and bloody, watery discharge for two to three weeks. Call your doctor if this discharge has an offensive smell, or if you notice increased bleeding or pelvic pain."
"Heal Cervicitis: Causes, Symptoms, Treatment, & More",Abstain from sexual activity.,"You cannot cure cervicitis without medical care, especially if the cervicitis is infectious. However, you can take steps at home to make yourself more comfortable and help the prescribed treatments to work effectively. Its important that you abstain from sexual activity until your doctor confirms you have healed from the infection.[17]If your cervicitis is infectious, you need to avoid spreading the bacteria or virus; even if your cervicitis is non-infectious, avoid having sexual intercourse as this could further irritate your cervix and make your symptoms worse."
"Heal Cervicitis: Causes, Symptoms, Treatment, & More",Avoid any vaginal irritants.,"Do not use products that may cause additional irritation or inflammation to your vagina or your cervix, including tampons and douching.[18]Use menstrual pads instead of tampons.Do not use scented soaps, sprays, or lotions. These and other products may cause irritation.Do not use a diaphragm for birth control."
"Heal Cervicitis: Causes, Symptoms, Treatment, & More","Wear comfortable, cotton under garments.","Avoid tight, constricting underwear made of synthetic fabrics, as this can cause irritation and a buildup of moisture in the genital area. Look for 100% cotton undergarments to allow your genital area to breathe and stay clean.[19]"

How to Get Rid of a Nerve Pinch in Your Neck Quickly: 14 Steps,Try gently stretching your neck if your symptoms have eased.,"Stretching your neck might help you feel a little better if your neck still feels tight after some of the pain has started to ease.[10] Use slow, steady movements and take deep breaths during your stretches. In general, hold stretches for about 30 seconds and repeat three to five times daily.While standing and looking straight ahead, slowly laterally flex your neck, bringing your ear gently towards your shoulder. After a few seconds of rest, then stretch the other side.Stretching directly after a warm shower or the application of moist heat is recommended because your neck muscles will be more pliable.If you have an inflamed facet joint, stretching will probably be painful and could aggravate your condition, so stop right away if the stretch hurts.[11]"
How to Get Rid of a Nerve Pinch in Your Neck Quickly: 14 Steps,See a medical specialist.,"Medical specialists such as an orthopedist, neurologist or rheumatologist may be needed to rule out the most serious causes of your neck pain, such as herniated disc, infection (osteomyelitis), osteoporosis, spinal fracture, rheumatoid arthritis or cancer.[12] These conditions are not common causes of neck pain, but if home care and conservative therapies are not effective, then more serious problems need to be considered.X-rays, bone scans, MRI, CT scan and nerve conductance studies are modalities that specialists may use to help diagnose your neck pain.[13]Your doctor may also send you for a blood test to rule out rheumatoid arthritis or a spinal infection such as meningitis.Sometimes, compressed nerves don't have any symptoms. If you have to have an MRI for another reason, for instance, you may be surprised to learn that you have compression to your nerves, even if you haven't experienced any pain.[14]"
How to Get Rid of a Nerve Pinch in Your Neck Quickly: 14 Steps,Talk to your doctor or physical therapist about traction.,"Traction is a technique to open the spaces between your vertebrae. Traction can come in many forms, from a therapist using his hands to manually traction your neck, to a traction table. There are also homemade traction devices. Always remember to traction the neck slowly. If there is any pain or numbness radiating into the arms, stop right away and see a doctor. Before using a home made traction device, its best to seek the advice of your physician, chiropractor, or physical therapist so he can help you pick the right one."
How to Get Rid of a Nerve Pinch in Your Neck Quickly: 14 Steps,Consider a facet joint injection.,"Your neck pain may be caused by chronic joint inflammation. A facet joint injection involves real-time fluoroscopic (X-ray) guidance of a needle through the neck muscles and into the inflamed or irritated spinal joint, followed by a release of an anesthetic and corticosteroid mixture, which quickly relieves both pain and inflammation at the site. Facet joint injections take 20  30 minutes to do and the results can last from a few weeks to a few months.[15]Facet joint injections are limited to three within a six-month time frame.The pain relief benefits from facet joint injections typically begin on the second or third day post treatment. Until that time frame, your neck pain may get a little worse.Potential complications of facet joint injections include infection, bleeding, local muscle atrophy and nerve irritation / damage."
How to Get Rid of a Nerve Pinch in Your Neck Quickly: 14 Steps,Consider surgery.,"Surgery for neck pain is the last resort and should only be considered after all other conservative therapies are proven ineffective and if the cause warrants such an invasive procedure. Remember that if the nerves in your neck are truly involved, you'll also notice shooting pains, numbness, and weakness or wasting in your arms and hands. Reasons for neck surgery may include to repair or stabilize a fracture (from trauma or osteoporosis), to remove a tumor, or repair a herniated disc.[16]Spinal surgery may involve the use of metal rods, pins or other devices for structural support.Stenosis is a condition where there's narrowing of either the holes where the nerve exits the spine, or the canal where the spinal cord runs off. Dealing with a herniated disc for stenosis may involve fusing two or more bones (vertebrae) together, which usually reduces range of motion.[17]Possible complications from back surgery include local infection, allergic reaction to anesthesia, nerve damage, paralysis and chronic swelling / pain.Because there's a risk of complications from surgery, talk to your doctor about alternative therapies that might improve your condition, first.[18]"
How to Get Rid of a Nerve Pinch in Your Neck Quickly: 14 Steps,Get a neck massage.,"A strained muscle occurs when individual muscle fibers are taken beyond their tensile limits and subsequently tear, which leads to pain, inflammation and some degree of guarding (muscle spasm in attempts to prevent further damage). As such, what you're calling a ""pinched nerve"" might actually be a strained neck muscle. A deep tissue massage is helpful for mild-to-moderate strains because it reduces muscle spasm, combats inflammation and promotes relaxation. Start with a 30 minute massage, focusing on your neck and upper back areas. Allow the therapist to go as deep as you can tolerate without wincing.Always drink lots of water immediately following a massage in order to flush out inflammatory by-products, lactic acid and toxins from your body. Failure to do so might cause a headache or mild nausea.As an alternative to professional massage therapy, use a tennis ball or vibratory device on your neck muscles  or better yet, ask a friend to do it. Roll the ball slowly around the neck tenderness for 10-15 minutes a few times daily until the pain subsides."
How to Get Rid of a Nerve Pinch in Your Neck Quickly: 14 Steps,Try physiotherapy (physical therapy).,"If your neck problem is recurring (chronic) and caused by weak muscles, poor posture or degenerative conditions such as osteoarthritis, then you need to consider some form of rehabilitation. A physical therapist can show you specific and tailored stretches and strengthening exercises for your neck.[19] Physiotherapy is usually required 2-3x per week for 4-6 weeks to positively impact chronic spinal problems.If need be, a physical therapist can treat your sore neck muscles with electrotherapy such as therapeutic ultrasound or electronic muscle stimulation.Good exercises for your neck include swimming, certain yoga positions and weight training, but make sure your injury is resolved first.A quality physical therapist will assess the lack of range of motion and strength in places other than just your neck, including your middle back, shoulders, and core. Then, they'll build a custom, tailored, corrective exercise program for you.[20]"
How to Get Rid of a Nerve Pinch in Your Neck Quickly: 14 Steps,See a chiropractor or osteopath.,"Chiropractors and osteopaths are spinal specialists that focus on establishing normal motion and function of the small spinal joints that connect the vertebrae, called facet joints. Manual joint manipulation, also called an adjustment, can be used to unjam or reposition cervical facet joints that are slightly misaligned, which triggers inflammation and sharp pain, particularly with movement. Traction of your neck may also help relieve your pain.Although a single spinal adjustment can sometimes completely relieve your pinched nerve, more than likely it will take 3-5 treatments to notice significant results.Chiropractors and osteopaths also use a variety of therapies tailored more towards muscle strains, which may be more appropriate for your neck issue."
How to Get Rid of a Nerve Pinch in Your Neck Quickly: 14 Steps,Consider acupuncture.,"Acupuncture involves sticking very thin needles into specific energy points within the skin / muscle in efforts to reduce pain and inflammation. Acupuncture for neck pain can be effective, especially if it's done when the symptoms first occur.[21] Based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture works by releasing a variety of substances including endorphins and serotonin, which act to reduce pain.It's also claimed that acupuncture stimulates the flow of energy, referred to as chi.Acupuncture is practiced by a variety of health professionals including some physicians, chiropractors, naturopaths, physical therapists and massage therapists."
How to Quickly and Effectively Learn Hiragana,Download a hiragana chart to organize your study.,"There are many hiragana charts online that you can download for free. While the design details are different, all charts follow the same basic format, because everybody learns hiragana basically the same way.[1]There's a hiragana character for every sound made in Japanese, which means anything you can say in Japanese, you can write in hiragana!Some charts also include the stroke order to use when writing hiragana. If handwriting hiragana is something you want to learn, you might find one of these charts more beneficial."
How to Quickly and Effectively Learn Hiragana,Pronounce the 5 hiragana vowels.,"The 5 characters that represent the hiragana vowels are either the top row or the first column of your hiragana chart, depending on how it's oriented. All the other blocks are characters that represent a consonant combined with each of those vowels, which makes the vowels a great place to start. Here are the sounds these hiragana represent:[2] (a) is a mix between the A sound in father and cat. (i) is pronounced like the ee in the English word ""eel."" (u) is an ""oo"" sound, somewhat like the ou in the English word ""you."" (e) is pronounced like the e in the English words ""exotic"" or ""egg."" (o) is an ""oh"" sound, somewhat like the o in the English word ""or."""
How to Quickly and Effectively Learn Hiragana,Build on the vowels with consonant sounds.,"The other rows (or columns, depending on your chart's orientation) of the hiragana chart add a consonant sound to the vowel sounds you just learned, although there are a few exceptions to this basic pattern, as you'll see. You can do this however you wantsome people prefer to learn all the hiragana for one vowel sound first, then move on to the next, while others go consonant-by-consonant. Here's a rough breakdown of the rest of the chart and the sounds represented:[3] (ka),  (ki),  (ku),  (ke),  (ko) (sa),  (shi),  (su),  (se),  (so) (ta),  (chi),  (tsu),  (te),  (to) (na),  (ni),  (nu),  (ne),  (no) (ha),  (hi),  (fu),  (he),  (ho) (ma),  (mi),  (mu),  (me),  (mo) (ya),  (yu),  (yo) (ra),  (ri),  (ru),  (re),  (ro) (wa),  (o),  (simply the ""n"" consonant sound without a vowel)"
How to Quickly and Effectively Learn Hiragana,"Practice your Japanese ""R"" sound.","If you're a native English speaker, the Japanese ""R"" is likely to give you the most difficulty. It's basically a combination of the English ""R,"" and ""L,"" sounds.. To get it right, try this exercise:[4]Say ""lah"" about a dozen times and pay attention to the position of your tongue on the roof of your mouth.Say ""dah"" about a dozen times, again paying attention to the position of your tongue on the roof of your mouth.Alternate between ""lah"" and ""dah"" and notice how the tip of your tongue moves back and forth between the same two positions.To pronounce the Japanese ""R,"" have the tip of your tongue hit the roof of your mouth directly in between the ""lah"" position and the ""dah"" position. Now all you have to do is practice until you've acquired the muscle memory of it."
How to Quickly and Effectively Learn Hiragana,Add dakuten or handakuten to change the sound of a hiragana character.,"You're probably thinking that surely the hiragana you've learned don't actually cover all the sounds in Japanese. What about the ""P"" in ""Pokemon"" (or in ""Japan"")? That's where dakuten () and handakuten ( ) come in to fill in all the blanks. Here's how they work:[5]""H"" becomes ""B"":  (ba),  (bi),  (bu),  (be),  (bo)""K"" becomes ""G"" (hard ""G"" as in the English word ""goat""):  (ga),  (gi),  (gu),  (ge),  (go)""S"" becomes ""Z"" (with 1 exception):  (za),  (ji),  (zu),  (ze),  (zo)""T"" becomes ""D"" (with 2 exceptions):  (da),  (ji),  (zu),  (de),  (do)""H"" becomes ""P"":  (pa),  (pi),  (pu),  (pe),  (po)"
How to Quickly and Effectively Learn Hiragana,Come up with mnemonics that resonate with you.,"There are many websites that claim they'll teach you hiragana quickly using mnemonicsand they absolutely will, as long as the mnemonics they use make sense to you.[6] But it's better to come up with your own mnemonics. Since that's what your brain sees in the character automatically, they'll be easier to remember than someone else's.[7]Here's an easy example:  looks like a ""No"" sign (  ) to many people. Conveniently enough, it also represents the sound ""no."" But what if that's not what you see? To you, it might look like a fortune cookieand if you don't like fortune cookies, you can just think ""no fortune cookies"" and you've got it!Here's another example: You might decide that  looks like a mouth to you. Since  represents the ""ku"" sound, your mnemonic could be a dove's beak saying ""coo, coo."""
How to Quickly and Effectively Learn Hiragana,Drill yourself with flash cards and spaced repetition.,"Standard hiragana flash cards have the character on one side and the sound it represents on the other. To use flash cards effectively, put the ones you're good at in a separate stack and review them less often than the ones you have trouble with. There are also some apps for your Android or iOS device that have the spaced repetition programmed in so all you have to worry about is learning. Here are a couple of popular options:[8]Anki has customizable flash cards available for Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android. Install the Japanese Support add-on to make sure it works for you to learn hiragana.Memrise has apps for iOS and Android. Disable ""tap"" questions so you have to type in your answer rather than using multiple choice."
How to Quickly and Effectively Learn Hiragana,Practice with a language app.,"There are tons of different language apps out there that claim they'll teach you a language quickly and easilyand most of them require you to pay a subscription that could be hundreds of dollars a year. But there are also some great free apps that can help you with your hiragana and Japanese language study:Duolingo has a free Japanese course that includes exercises that will teach you hiragana. In addition to the desktop version, the app is also available for Android and iOS devices.Dr. Moku offers a free app for Android and iOS devices (with a paid option). The company also makes physical flash cards if that's more your thing.Hiragana Quest is a game created in partnership with Japanese language school Go! Go! Nihon that will teach you all 46 characters of hiragana and all 46 characters of katakana. It's available for Android and iOS devices."
How to Quickly and Effectively Learn Hiragana,Trace hiragana on practice sheets to learn stroke order.,"If you want to be able to write hiragana, download and print practice sheets to help you. If you learned to write English with handwriting paper that had double lines, you'll recognize the similarity.[9]Even though the stroke order isn't emphasized as much as it used to be, it's still an efficient way to learn how to create hiragana characters in your own hand."
How to Quickly and Effectively Learn Hiragana,Combine hiragana to form Japanese words you already know.,"You likely already know a few Japanese words, such as oyasumi (sleep well) and saynara (goodbye). Sound out the word into syllables, then find the hiragana that matches that syllable. You're writing in Japanese! Here are some examples to get you started:[10] is sushi. Don't you think  looks like a fishhook? is kawaii. is saynara is o + ya + su + mi. oyasumi. See if you can break this word down into its syllables, as represented by the hiragana characters."
How to Quickly and Effectively Learn Hiragana,Read picture books for Japanese children.,"Japanese kids are learning hiragana just like you are, so books designed for beginning readers are perfect to start learning how to read hiragana.

How to Quickly and Effectively Learn Hiragana,Watch a Japanese show with Japanese subtitles.,"Streaming services, such as Netflix and Hulu, also have Japanese-language shows and movies (although your selection might be limited). Just choose Japanese under the language option, then turn on subtitles. You could also try Crunchyroll, which has an ad-supported free option with access to most of the shows you'd get on the paid tier.[12]Start with shows for kids since they're likely to use the simplest language.A word of caution: depending on the speed of dialogue in the show, the subtitles sometimes move too fast for beginners to follow. They might also include quite a bit of kanji, which you don't know yet."
How to Quickly and Effectively Learn Hiragana,Change your computer's keyboard language to Japanese.,"If you can understand simple Japanese written in hiragana, you might want to try typing it yourself. Place a hiragana keyboard skin over your keyboard at first, until you develop muscle memory for the locations of the characters.[13]If you're using a tablet or smartphone, the characters on the onscreen keyboard will automatically change when you change the keyboard's language.Search for forums and social media groups that use hiragana. The posts from others will help you practice reading, and you can check your understanding by typing replies in hiragana.Typing hiragana on your computer or device is also a great way to familiarize yourself with how hiragana looks in different fonts."
How to Quickly and Effectively Learn Hiragana,Use furigana to start learning kanji.,"Furigana includes kanji characters over kanji so that you can sound out the word they represent.[14] Try Nippon Talk, which has articles about everyday life in Japan. The articles are written in full Japanese with furigana that you can toggle on and off.If Japanese children's books have any kanji, they typically also include furigana over the kanji characters."
"How to Care for an FIV-Positive Cat: Food, Health, and More",Feed your FIV positive cat a nutritious diet.,"It is important to give your cat a good diet in order to keep him or her as healthy as possible despite the FIV. Ask your veterinarian about good, quality brands of cat food."
"How to Care for an FIV-Positive Cat: Food, Health, and More",Feed your cat dry kibble.,"Dry kibble is the best food you can feed your cat, as wet food has a tendency to build up on teeth, causing tartar buildup that can lead to infections. Your primary goal should be to do everything you can to keep your cat infection-free because FIV causes it to be very susceptible to infections.[1]"
"How to Care for an FIV-Positive Cat: Food, Health, and More",Feed your cat food that is appropriate for its age.,"Vets often recommend life-stage diets from Hills, Purina, and Royal Canin. These diets provide for the specific nutritional needs of young animals (under 12 months of age), adults (classed as 1  7 years), and senior animals (over the age of 7 years). Matching the life-stage diet to the age of your cat can promote longevity."
"How to Care for an FIV-Positive Cat: Food, Health, and More",Get your cat vaccinated regularly.,"FIV causes your cats immune system to become weak, which means that it is very susceptible to other illnesses, like cat flu. Because of this, it's important that you get your cat vaccinated against illnesses every year.Talk to your vet about which vaccines to give your cat, as some diseases are more common in certain areas than others.[2] Your vet will most likely suggest that you get your cat vaccinated against feline distemper and other cat viruses."
"How to Care for an FIV-Positive Cat: Food, Health, and More",Keep your cat parasite-free.,"A FIV-infected cats body is less likely to handle infections well. FIV-infected cats also need all the nutrients that they can get and many parasites will rob your cats body of those nutrients. You need to treat your cat for both internal and external parasites.[3]Control worms (internal parasites) with milbemax (containing milbemycin.) This wormer is effective against all classes of worms. Indoor cats should be dosed once every three to four months. Cats allowed outdoor access, especially those that hunt rodents, should be wormed monthly.External parasites such as fleas and ticks can also compromise your cats health. Vets often recommend Stronghold (UK)/ Revolution (US). This external parasite medication combats all external parasites in the same way that milbemax fights internal parasites."
"How to Care for an FIV-Positive Cat: Food, Health, and More",Boost your cats immune system with vitamins it can eat.,"It is a good idea to boost its immune system with vitamins. You can give your cat vitamin E, vitamin A, vitamin C, selenium, and zinc.[4]Talk to your vet about the proper dose for your specific cat. Your vet will most likely recommend something along the lines of 3 to 5 ml of LC-vit daily or 5 ml of Nutri-Plus Gel daily."
"How to Care for an FIV-Positive Cat: Food, Health, and More",Talk to your vet about giving your cat injectable vitamins.,"If your cat is very weak and has a hard time eating, you should consider giving him or her injectable vitamins to boost its health. Again, it is always important to talk to your vet before giving your cat any supplements or medication.An injectable supplement that is often recommended by vets is Coforta, which is injected at 0.5ml to 2.5 ml per cat once a day for 5 days during a single treatment period.[5]"
"How to Care for an FIV-Positive Cat: Food, Health, and More",Give your cat L-lysine supplements.,L-lysine is a supplement that can help prevent flare-ups of infections that are common in FIV-positive cats. L-lysine aids in protein synthesis and is involved in tissue repair and maintenance. The recommended dose is generally 500 mg daily mixed with food.Talk to your vet before giving your cat supplements.
"How to Care for an FIV-Positive Cat: Food, Health, and More",Consider interferon treatment for your FIV-positive cat.,"In interferon therapy, your cat is injected intravenously with interferons, substances that are part of the immune system and help to fight viral and bacterial infections. By increasing the number of interferons in your cats body, your cat becomes more resistant to infections, which means that it has a better chance of living a long, happy life.[6]Interferons are speciality medications that are veterinarian administered. They can be costly, but studies have shown they have minimal side effects in cats.[7][8]"
"How to Care for an FIV-Positive Cat: Food, Health, and More",Seek veterinary help if your cat shows signs of illness.,"FIV-positive cats have a much harder time fighting off infections and other illnesses. Because of this, it is best to take your cat into the vet as soon as you notice that it is sick, rather than waiting to see if the situation will resolve itself. Generally, your cat will simply need to be put on antibiotics to help his or her body fight the infections. You should always be on the look out for signs that your cat is feeling unwell, including:Coughing.Sneezing.Runny eyes or nose.Decreased appetite.Increased thirst.Vomiting or diarrhea."
"How to Care for an FIV-Positive Cat: Food, Health, and More",Minimize the amount of stress your cat feels.,"Stress can have physical effects on your cat because his or her immune system is already weak. When an animal is stressed, its body releases a natural steroidcortisolin order to help the body cope with the stress. Long term exposure to cortisol suppresses the immune system and, in a cat that already has a weakened immune system, this will decrease his or her limited ability to fight infection.[9]:"
"How to Care for an FIV-Positive Cat: Food, Health, and More",Keep your cats routine the same.,"Change can really stress a cat out, from having a new pet around to moving to a new house. Try to keep your cats environment as normal as possible.Don't forget to continue to play with your cat. Give it toys and spend quality time with it as usual.

"How to Care for an FIV-Positive Cat: Food, Health, and More",Understand how FIV is transmitted.,"It is important to know how FIV is spread so that you can keep your FIV-free cats healthy and make sure that your FIV-positive cat still has a happy life. FIV is most commonly spread through a cats saliva, though it can also be spread through blood and semen. The most common way for a cat to contract FIV is through getting bit by an FIV-positive cat. [10]Keep in mind that FIV is a relatively fragile virus that cannot survive in the environment beyond a few seconds. Outside the body, FIV is rapidly damaged by drying, UV, heat, light and basic disinfectants, and poses no risk to other cats. The virus requires direct transmission from infected saliva of one cat, into the bloodstream of a healthy cat."
"How to Care for an FIV-Positive Cat: Food, Health, and More",Consider keeping your FIV-positive and FIV-negative cats separate.,"Studies have shown that it is not absolutely necessary to keep your healthy cats separate from your FIV-positive cats if they get along well. If your cats have a tendency to fight, however, it is a good idea to keep them separate.In studies done by the University of Glasgow, it was found that when FIV-free and FIV-positive cats were around each other, there was a 1-2% transmission rate.[11] You will have to decide whether that 1 to 2% is too much of a risk to take."
"How to Care for an FIV-Positive Cat: Food, Health, and More",Spay or neuter your FIV-positive cat.,"When cats get spayed (females) or neutered (males), they become less aggressive, which means that the chances that they will get into fights is greatly reduced. If you have an FIV-positive cat that you want to remain an outdoor cat, it is a good idea to get it fixed so that it is less likely to bite another cat in a fight.[12]"

Male cats tend to roam over large distances, sometimes across several acres and are likely to encounter other cats on their travels. If he is likely to scrap with these cats, then it is essential to keep him indoors.[13]Keeping a territorial cat indoors might not be the most ideal situation, particularly if he is used to roaming around outside, but it might be the only way to keep him from spreading FIV to other cats in your neighborhood."
"How to Care for an FIV-Positive Cat: Food, Health, and More","Talk to a vet about the health of cats in your area, particularly if you live in a city.","If you live in a city, it is a good idea to talk to a local veterinarian about the incidence of FIV in the area. If there is a large population of feral cats who are FIV-positive, you may want to keep FIV-free cats indoors but may feel alright about letting your FIV-positive cat stay an outdoor cat. If FIV is rare in a high cat density neighborhood, then, as a responsible owner, you should keep your FIV-positive pet indoors.If you live in an area with a low population of cats, such as remote countryside, then the risk of cats meeting and fighting is low, and it is acceptable to let your FIV-positive cat out."
"How to Care for an FIV-Positive Cat: Food, Health, and More",Take your cat to be examined if it gets bitten by another cat.,"Check your cat for bite marks regularly. You should take your cat to the vet if you notice a bite mark and at the same time that it develops a fever. FIV causes a severe fever that will last for 3 to 7 days. When you take your cat to the vet he or she will check for:Swollen lymph nodes. When cats become ill, their lymph nodes swell up. Your vet will check to see if this is occurring in your cat.[14]White blood cell levels. FIV causes decreases in white blood cell counts. Your vet will take a blood sample to see if your cat has low white blood cell counts."
"How to Care for an FIV-Positive Cat: Food, Health, and More",Be aware that your cat will become a carrier and might not exhibit symptoms.,"Most cats recover from the first stage of the disease (the fever and low white blood cell counts). When they recover, they will stop exhibiting signs of illness but will still carry the disease. This period of health can last for several months to several years.[15]Doing all of the things will help lengthen your cats life and prolong this stage in which she is just a carrier of the disease."
"How to Care for an FIV-Positive Cat: Food, Health, and More",Look for signs of terminal illness that are commonly associated with FIV.,"FIV causes immune deficiency that can lead to your cat developing other illnesses. You should monitor your cat for any signs of illness including[16]:Chronic respiratory infections caused by bacteria and viruses.Gastrointestinal infections and diarrhea (Gastroenteritis).Skin lesions (sores).Mouth lesions (sores).Neurological symptoms like psychomotor problems (like trouble moving around), psychological problems, dementia, and convulsions.Weakness.Emaciation.Dull or poor coat.Chronic urinary tract infections."

How to Become a Car Designer: 11 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Do mock drawings for different companies.,"Your portfolio should showcase your creativity and innovation. But it should also demonstrate an awareness of current design types and styles used by major automotive companies. Professional automotive designers are expected to engineer designs that will fit within an existing corporate look or design portfolio of a company. Choose several big names in cars, such as Ford, Toyota, or Volkswagen, and create sketches based on the existing designs of their cars.[4]For example, Ford uses a theme called Kinetic Design. The design centers on the idea of a motionless object appearing as though it is moving. This theme influences the design of every Ford car, from sportier models like the Focus ST to family focused models like the 4x4.

How to Prepare Used Cooking Oil for Biodiesel: 13 Steps,Dissolve lye into distilled water.,"In a glass container, add a gram of lye to one liter of distilled water. This is a 0.1% lye solution used as a testing device for the pH level of your oil.[6]Use extreme care when handling lye, as it is a toxic substance. Wear eye protection and rubber gloves at all times, handle in a well-ventilated space, and be sure to label your lye and 0.1% lye solution clearly. If lye gets onto your skin, neutralize it immediately with vinegar, and rinse with cool water.You can obtain lye as a household drain cleaning product, but you must ensure that it is 100% lye with no other ingredients added. If you order from a chemical supplier, you can use sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH)Use the same ratio of lye to distilled water if you want to make a larger or smaller quantity of test solution. You can store this solution with a tight lid for testing of future oil batches."

How to Discipline Your Flesh As a Christian (with Pictures),Take your level of submission into account.,"Saints devote their life to Jesus by living, dressing, conducting themselves in a certain way. Devoted Christian's live their faith according to their limits and understanding. There are different levels of submission that you can do. How far disciplined do you intend to be? ""No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it"" (1 Corinthians 10:13).Disciplines to avoid sin?Being able to control yourself in any situation; tough or easy?Just living with a clear conscience?Doing every good that Jesus asked His followers to do?Being disciplined enough to get over addictions that you might have?Living in perfect grace and in absolute holiness as possible for you?"
How to Discipline Your Flesh As a Christian (with Pictures),Be ready for what it takes.,"Disciplining flesh is not just about flesh. It requires a wholesome effort. ""For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline"" (2 Timothy 1:7).You will be required to be ready for Jesus to work in you.Give up on tempting activities that are sinful.Observe the ten commandments.Be willing to act in true sense as a Christian.Be persistent and keep trying."

""I can do all this through him who gives me strength"" (Philippians 4:13)."
How to Discipline Your Flesh As a Christian (with Pictures),Do not resent it.,"Disciplining your flesh requires as much strength as happiness and gratitude. Remember, you are doing it for yourself. It will bless you and help you gain a better perspective of life and God. Failure, friend's adventures, others' leisure may all seem too unfair on you. But it is not yours to judge others. You have your life in your control. So make it what you are determined on making and be very happy doing so.

Praise Jesus regularly. Constant spiritual change needs a firm grasp on Jesus to feel stable and safe. Keep thanking Jesus and ask for help whenever you feel weak or terrified of your growth."
How to Discipline Your Flesh As a Christian (with Pictures),Know what you will doing and not doing.,"Make a list of activities that take your time, doing which you spent your day. Separate the activities based on needs and wants. Man has fewer needs as compared to wants and desires. Cut out all that you could from the wants section. Remove or reduce everything that you are addicted to. ""Rather, he must be hospitable, one who loves what is good, who is self-controlled, upright, holy and disciplined"" (Titus 1:8).Take it slow.Be consistent."
How to Discipline Your Flesh As a Christian (with Pictures),"Deny yourself, and keep improving as Jesus said:","""If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me"" (Matthew 16:24). Learn to say no to yourself. The essence of self-control is being able to say no to yourself. You may have a craving or you may be tempted to do something, but success in the area of self-control is when you can tell yourself no. To not give into every whim or thought or temptation, that is true self-control. ""The tongue has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat its fruit"" (Proverbs 18:21).In order to reach this level of self-control, you have to discipline your flesh, and deny yourself of whatever you might want. It helps to see the reality that your flesh always wants what is bad for you. ""If you live according to the flesh, you will die"" Paul said. So know that any bad habits and lusts of your flesh will eventually harm or kill you, or will at least lead to a shorter life.Over eating will most likely lead to obesity, heart trouble, and many other health problems. Watching too much TV may lead to a lack of intelligent interests and can cause relationship avoidance, issues of avoiding real life. Working too much will lead you to be over-stressed and may even cause you a nervous breakdown. Realize that your flesh is set against you, because Satan is in control of your flesh, but know that following God and the Holy Spirit will bring you ""life and peace."""
How to Discipline Your Flesh As a Christian (with Pictures),Talk to Jesus.,"Yehoshua or Jesus is always around you, watching you. All you need to talk to Jesus is desiring to do it. Find a quiet place in your home or where you are most of the time, think of no one or nothing else and ask Jesus to talk to you. Ask Him to guide you in your chosen path. ""Do not conformto the pattern of this world,but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.Then you will be able to test and approve what Gods will is - His good, pleasing and perfect will"" (Romans 12:2).Pray that you can hear Him talk to you.Pray in your own words by devoting yourself to be disciplined by Him.Ask Him to make you more focused.Give Him authority over your life, as you feel."
How to Discipline Your Flesh As a Christian (with Pictures),Keep the end goal in sight.,"Jesus said in John 12:24, ""Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but, if it dies, it bears much fruit."" A person might diet and die to himself/ herself in order to get a better body, but what about your soul? What about the fruitfulness of our hearts?Jesus said unless you, being the grain of wheat, die, as in die to yourself, then you will produce no fruit. Your life won't have any meaning. You won't be helping anyone. But, if you can learn to die to yourself, to discipline your flesh, then maybe you can help Jesus change the world. Then maybe your life will have meaning, purpose and significance. To live for yourself alone will only make you miserable, but to live for, and love others, will bring more joy to your life than you can even imagine."
How to Discipline Your Flesh As a Christian (with Pictures),Understand the necessity of self-discipline and self-control.,"Jesus said in Matthew 10:38, ""Whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me."" To call yourself a Christian means that you are willing to die to yourself. It means that it is no longer all about you; it is now all about Jesus.Jesus said that unless you are willing to die to yourself, you are not worthy of him. Paul repeatedly says that we are to ""walk in a manner worthy of our calling."" Our worthiness does not save us. The Bible says that ""While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."" But, if we are truly saved, we will live in a worthy manner. Our lives will show evidence that we really are born again. We will be an entirely new creation; the old will be gone, and the new will have come.Christians still fall into sin from time to time, but sin should not be allowed to be habitual or as your lifestyle. Sin should not be able to dominate you and control you as it once did, because Jesus has set you free. Jesus said that many will say to him on that day that they are real Christians, but he will tell them ""I never knew you."" Thinking we are saved is not enough, we have to act like it, and follow Jesus. Love one another. ""Show me your faith without (good) deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do."""
How to Discipline Your Flesh As a Christian (with Pictures),Increase the time doing spiritual tasks.,"Apart from fulfilling your daily responsibilities and social role that of a student/ homemaker/ professional employee etc, spend your time being more disciplined. Dedicate your days to spiritual tasks based on your desired level. ""Therefore, I urge you,brothers and sisters, in view of Gods mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice,holy and pleasing to God - this is your true and proper worship"" (Romans 12:1). Spend your days thus -Knowing about what happened to Jesus.Clearing your doubts about life by reading the parables, verses, proverbs, letters and so in.Learning right and wrong by reading the bible,Reading about the disciples,Knowing about the blessed people,Reading both, the old and the new testament.Seeing how their paths and choices apply to your life."
How to Discipline Your Flesh As a Christian (with Pictures),Put to death the lusts of the flesh.,"The Bible uses the term ""the flesh"" to refer to the tendency to sin. Innate sin nature passed down to us from Adam and Eve is referred to as the flesh. The flesh is always at war with the Holy Spirit within us. The flesh wants to do what is bad, and the Holy Spirit in your spirit wants to do what is good.Live out your higher calling: ""If you live according to the flesh, you will die; but, if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live."" (Romans 8:13). Also Colossians 3:5 says, ""Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry."" Self discipline has to be active and continually done. This is not automatically done for us when we put our faith in Christ.""The righteousness of Christ"" now covers us, as in that is how God now sees us, but we do not become righteous the moment we get saved. Paul says ""Not that I have already obtained all this or have already been made perfect, but I press on toward the goal..."" We receive the Holy Spirit when we put our faith in Jesus, who then guides us and helps us to put our flesh to death, but it is a partnering effort. We work at putting to death the fleshly lusts, and the Holy Spirit helps us."
How to Discipline Your Flesh As a Christian (with Pictures),Learn to love self-control.,"This pursuit tends to get sweet as it progresses. Many fruits along the way awakens your spirits. It seem like every person alive has an addiction to something. For some it's food and over eating, for others it's watching TV constantly, for others it's being workaholic, etc. The trick is to learn when you have reached your limit in any of these things. Learn to exercise self-control. ""Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me - put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you"" (Philippians 4:9).Learn to stop eating when you feel full. Learn to turn the T.V off when you feel you have wasted enough hours of the day doing nothing. Learn to rest when you feel tired, and do not overwork yourself.If we don't stop when we have hit what we know is a limit, the Holy Spirit will convict us. We can try to quench the Holy Spirit, as in ignore his promptings and convictions, but then we will only feel miserable. Paul says in 1 Cor. 6:12, ""'I have the right to do anything,' you say--but not everything is beneficial. 'I have the right to do anything'--but I will not be mastered by anything."" Don't let grace be an excuse for license, or you will become enslaved and mastered by sin once again."
How to Discipline Your Flesh As a Christian (with Pictures),Keep the focus on yourself rather than on the behavior of others.,"""My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this - Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry"" (James 1:19). So often times, in order to distract ourselves from our own problems, we will judge and criticize others. This is merely a way of deflecting. We don't want the light shining on ourselves so we shine it on others. Or we attack them for something before they have the chance to attack us. But instead, we need to look inward at our own inner life.The Bible says, ""Judge not lest ye be judged."" You may think that you are distracting the other person from seeing your own sin, but eventually, they will judge you and shine the light on you in return. What goes around comes around. If you are gracious with others, they will be gracious with you. But if you judge them, they will eventually judge you too.Plus you need to focus on how you need to be a better person rather than thinking how they need to be a better person. And you can't change them anyway; the one and only person you can change is yourself."
How to Discipline Your Flesh As a Christian (with Pictures),Appear happy and feel grateful towards Jesus.,"Be trained as explained: ""No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it"" (Hebrews 12:11). To be happy, you need to know what you are to be happy about. This act of yours needs to be properly observed. Keep looking back at who you were emotionally and how you feel after a period of time and turmoil. It is not a very leisurely or easy path.

Strength, stability, self-control and love for Jesus grows as you work in this pure direction."

How to Conduct Research: Collecting & Organizing Facts,Learn about the different kinds of research you can conduct.,"Research happens any time you actively seek out information about a specific topic. You can research to explore a topic you're unfamiliar with, as well as to provide evidence for claims you're making in a presentation or research essay. Research can be collected by gathering your own data, reading online, or using previous research projects to guide your efforts.[1]Exploratory research is done when you read online, getting the quickest summary of the topic at hand. Say you were researching the general topic of ""obesity"" in the United States. To explore the topic, you might start with a Google search, read the wikipedia page, and find other web entries to get yourself familiar with the topic. What's the issue with obesity in the US? What arguments are being made about it? What other subjects are related to this topic? Health and fitness? Fast-food? What are you interested in researching further? In this kind of research, you're looking for facts.[2]Supportive research occurs when you find those arguments in academic sources. What are academic sources? Anything that has been published, be it magazines, books, or the online database version of academic research journals. In this kind of research, you're looking for more than facts. You're looking for opinions and arguments of different sorts, related to your topic, that you can use to form an opinion and argument of your own."
How to Conduct Research: Collecting & Organizing Facts,Write down what you don't know.,"Once you've explored a topic somewhat, there's still a lot you might not know, and this is what you can use to guide your research by forming a research question.[3] Start asking lots of questions and writing them down: When people refer to the ""obesity epidemic,"" what are they referring to exactly? When did it start? Where? What are some possible reasons that it may exist?"
How to Conduct Research: Collecting & Organizing Facts,Find the controversy and the conversation.,"Within every topic there is an ""issue,"" at stake. There's something debatable, something controversial about the topic, and that's what you want to spend time researching. The smaller, narrower, and more specific the topic, the better.[4]The topic of obesity in the US might be too large. Look at your own community, state, or region. What are the statistics? How does it compare to other regions? What might account for this? Why? If you're asking and answering these questions, you're well on your way to a solid research topic.Issues of fact don't make good research topics, because there's nothing to research, there's just a fact to look up. A good research question, for instance, wouldn't be ""How many people have died from obesity?"" but ""How does obesity kill?"""
How to Conduct Research: Collecting & Organizing Facts,Ask a probing question you hope to explore with research.,"After you've been exploring your topic online and possibly in print, you need to come up with a solid research question to help guide your supportive research.[5]""What policies and attitudes resulted in the sudden rise in obesity in Indiana during the mid-90s?"" would be an excellent research topic. It's specific in terms of location, controversy, and topic. It's something you can prove."
How to Conduct Research: Collecting & Organizing Facts,"Let the research guide your argument, not the other way around.","[6] We all have strong opinions about topics, especially controversial ones. It can be tempting to only seek out sources that will validate your opinion, or that will oversimplify the topic, rather than complicate it. As you do your research, seek out a variety of opinions, arguments, and positions, and allow yourself to assemble the strongest possible research, not just the arguments you want to hear."
How to Conduct Research: Collecting & Organizing Facts,Use the Internet for exploratory research.,"Depending on your topic, the Internet may be a wealth of information or a swampy region of opinions and comment streams. It's got the most current information available instantly, but it can also be difficult to distinguish between good sources and bad sources.[7]Government websites (ones that end in .gov) are good sources of data and definitions. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention site, for instance, has lots of good data about obesity in the US, how the disease affects specific populations, and a breakdown of obesity by region.Non-profits (websites that end in .org) can also be good sources of opinions. Generally, organizations will have an ""agenda"" and will present a variety of information that backs up their position. This can be good in aiding your research, but can also feature a fair amount of spin on the issues.Blogs and message boards can be good for getting a sense of people's opinions and are good for coming up with ideas for questions you can ask yourself, but they're not good sources of support. They're not good for quotes, in other words."
How to Conduct Research: Collecting & Organizing Facts,Use the Internet to define terms quickly.,"Is obesity a disease? What do we mean by calling it an ""epidemic""? These are terms you can and should look up quickly online. By defining your terms and becoming more familiar with the topic--becoming an amateur expert on it, in fact--you'll be more informed when you get to the much more technical kinds of sources you'll need to use for your supportive research."
How to Conduct Research: Collecting & Organizing Facts,"Use Wikipedia as a resource, but not as a source.","One of the great things about a wiki (like wikiHow!) is that the sources referenced throughout the article are available at the bottom of the page for you to explore yourself. These are often better sources of information than the wiki itself, and the organization of the page allows for you to use it as a summary of the information in those sources, rather than a source unto itself."
How to Conduct Research: Collecting & Organizing Facts,Find substantial articles and opinions.,"When you're reading online, look for a mixture of statistics and data, as well as opinions. It's not necessarily helpful to have a ranting blog full of someone's conspiracies about growth hormones in school lunches being a conspiracy to keep kids obese, but there might be something there to inspire you. What is the deal with school lunches? What research has been done? Do more exploring and find a more substantial page with similar information.[8]"
How to Conduct Research: Collecting & Organizing Facts,Talk to a librarian.,"The most helpful source of information at libraries isn't books. Often, librarians sit idly by while students struggle on computers not twenty feet away, digging through a difficult swamp of bad information and poor sources. Talk to them! They're here to help.[9]Bring your research question and any research you've done to this point, as well as any particular assignments or project descriptions that you've got with you. If you're doing research for a paper, bring the assignment sheet.Ask at the front desk for research librarians who are on-call for student consultations, or make an appointment yourself with a topic librarian in a specific field. These meetings tend to be very beneficial. You won't waste time trying to negotiate the difficult library databases, and you'll be sure the kind of information you find will be helpful for your project."
How to Conduct Research: Collecting & Organizing Facts,"Research books, magazines, and databases of information.","[10] At the library, you've got more information that you'll know what to do with. Try to find only the most directly-related information. If you're struggling to find good sources, try refining your search terms and looking again.Books obviously make for good overviews of topics. If you're researching obesity, you'll be able to find long-range research studies, expert analysis, and opinions on books in the subject.Magazines and research journals will provide more specialized and technical topics, usually at a somewhat shorter length. They're be lighter on opinion and heavier on dry statistics.Most university libraries use JSTOR or some variant of an academic database that houses research articles by topic. It can be a somewhat difficult database to negotiate, so talk to a librarian for help if you're unsure."
How to Conduct Research: Collecting & Organizing Facts,Try a mixture of search terms.,"It can be frustrating when you first get started at the library in trying to find information directly related to your searches. Learning to search effectively and be diligent with your efforts will pay off in the end. Vary your searches, using quotations around specific searches you want the engine to look for. If you were looking for information about obesity, specifically related to the school lunch program, you might search for:""obesity""""obesity"" ""school lunch""""school lunch""""junk food in schools""""Indiana obesity""""Indiana school lunches""""weight epidemic""""obesity epidemic"""
How to Conduct Research: Collecting & Organizing Facts,Don't read every word.,"Learning to read quickly and skim effectively for important and on-topic information is often the difference between a smooth research project and a frustrating one. If you're getting deep into a really complicated technical topic, a lot of the research can be dry and downright boring. Learning to negotiate the sources quickly will make your job much easier.Read the abstract, if the source has one, or read the introduction to the source to make sure the topic is applicable. If it seems peripheral, put it back and forget about it. You're not doing research to pad your bibliography, you're doing it to support your argument and explore the topic.If you find a good source, skip forward to the end and read the summary. Much of the ""meat"" of technical research-based sources will be spent presenting their own research, whereas you're mostly concerned with the findings and the argument itself. Often, you can get away with only reading a few paragraphs of a 15 or 20 page research report or book if you read smart.If the source provides excellent support, read the article more closely to get a sense of the argument and the evidence. Use the author's own research to look for more sources."
How to Conduct Research: Collecting & Organizing Facts,Take good notes so you'll be able to find information later.,"There's nothing worse than getting to the writing phase of a research project at not being able to find a particular quote or statistic in the pile of research you've collected. Stay organized while you're researching and take careful notes to refer to later.Take note cards to the library and write down specific quotes on one side of the card and the bibliographical information (Title, author, publication info, and URL if applicable) on the other side of the card."
How to Conduct Research: Collecting & Organizing Facts,Don't overwhelm yourself with sources.,"A good day at the library doesn't necessarily involve stacking up a mountain of 500-page books you'll never read. Research smart, taking notes on the most important parts of the information, and use a manageable number of sources to make your argument and serve your argument.Some students think more sources makes a research paper better. It doesn't. Ideally, you want a balance of ""their"" voice--meaning the research--and your voice, your argument. A good research project uses the research to form and support an argument, not to act like a ventriloquist dummy, repeating information you read at length."
How to Conduct Research: Collecting & Organizing Facts,"Perform primary research for local or subjective subjects, if the project calls for it.","Some topics and projects will call for primary research, which means that you'll collect the data yourself. If you've got a really localized topic--like the obesity problem at your University, for instance--you might want to consider creating a short questionnaire or other way of analyzing data of concern to your project.[11]"
How to Conduct Research: Collecting & Organizing Facts,Find a sample size that works for you.,"No surveys or questionnaires get to everyone. How many would be enough to get a good sense of the issue. Will it mean anything to gather opinions about obesity form 20 guys in the locker room? Everyone on your dorm floor? 300 people at the football game?[12]Be conscious of bias. Aim for a somewhat distributed mix of men and women, of different ages, socioeconomic backgrounds, and places of birth."
How to Conduct Research: Collecting & Organizing Facts,Decide how you'll collect your data.,"If you're after opinions, a questionnaire is the best and most efficient way of collecting data, but it might not be particularly applicable to your topic.[13]If you're interested in food habits and the availability of junk food in cafeterias, consider posting up beside the lunch line a few days a week and counting the number of students who forego the full lunches in favor of deserts, sodas, or candy. Keep a running tally.Interviews might be good if you have access to experts or other parties involved directly in the topic you're researching. If you want to learn about school lunches, talk to the lunch workers, the principal of your school, or other people who may be involved. Let them know what you're researching and explain the project before talking to them."
How to Conduct Research: Collecting & Organizing Facts,Gather your research.,"Once you've picked a method of collection, distribute your surveys, observe your behaviors, or conduct your interviews and collect your research. Analyze the research and summarize your findings in a way that you'll be able to use it for your research.[14]If your hypothesis about the research ends up being wrong, don't fret. This in and of itself can be a good source of information to present in a project, displaying your commitment to finding out ""the truth"" of the topic at hand."
How to Conduct Research: Collecting & Organizing Facts,Evaluate your sources.,"When you've collected your research, identify the most persuasive arguments and sources and use them as a jumping off point for your own argument. If you found that districts with schools that feature vending machines experience a 30 percent higher obesity rate, how can you transition that into an argument to support with that research? What does the research say?[15]"
How to Conduct Research: Collecting & Organizing Facts,Form a thesis statement,"from your research. A thesis statement is the central thing you hope to prove by presenting your research. It should be debatable and specific, giving you a road map for where the research essay or project might go. A good thesis statement helps the writer as much as the reader, because it gives you a tangible thing to prove with the writing.[16]A bad thesis statement might be ""Schools need to do more to avoid obesity."" This is vague and difficult to prove. What schools? What do they need to do? ""Adams High School could significantly drop the obesity rate in the student body and even the region by removing the vending machines and offering a diversity of healthy choices"" does a lot more to present an argument and give you something to prove."
How to Conduct Research: Collecting & Organizing Facts,Learn to paraphrase and quote effectively.,"How do you present your research in a readable way?[17]Paraphrase to translate a source into your own words. These should always be attributed, but not quoted, and are most effective when you need to briefly summarize a position or argument. You've still given credit to the author, so we know the observation isn't your own. In other words, you might write:According to Adams, schools that feature vending machines in the lunch rooms experience an increase in obesity rates.Quote any language directly sourced from the article. This is effectively used when there's something in the wording of the source that you want to emphasize or highlight as part of your research:According to Adams, ""The inclusion of vending machines markedly increases the junk food desires of students in those schools, resulting in a chain reaction that rewards their bad choices.""Learn to recognize and avoid plagiarism. It can happen accidentally, so you need to learn to recognize the ways in which it occurs and avoid it."
How to Conduct Research: Collecting & Organizing Facts,Cite your sources,". If you're writing a research essay, you need to learn to effectively provide citation information for each source you reference, be it paraphrase or quotation, throughout the source.[18] Use a parenthetical or footnote citation in the text of your paper, and include a list of references or a Works Cited page at the end of the paper including the publishing information for each source. Your teacher may want you to use a particular style of citation, but the most popular include:[19]MLAAPAChicago StyleTurabian"

How to Read Your Chinese Horoscope: 13 Steps (with Pictures),Don't just stop at your Zodiac sign!,"There is far, far more to Chinese astrology than just the twelve signs of the Zodiac. There's also the Four Pillars of Destiny -- which does use the Zodiac, but goes much, much further. It uses the year you were born and the month, day, and time of your birth, as well. It's similar to the birth chart used in Western astrology. It is believed to be a lot more accurate, telling more about your personal life instead of your sign as a whole.[4]The four pillars are those four factors, in that order. They are also combined with yin and yang and the 5 elements (metal, wood, water, fire, earth). It is all believed to determine your luck, affluence, longevity, happiness, and wealth year by year.Chinese astrology works in 60 year cycles. If you're a math fiend with nothing better to do, you could break down the patterns of all these ideas into a sexagesimal cycle."

Therefore, each year is just a teeny bit different.Because it'd be ridiculous to list the entire 60-day cycle here, it's advisable to visit an online calculator to find out your element and Zodiac sign for your day.

How to Read Your Chinese Horoscope: 13 Steps (with Pictures),Know your secret animal.,"In the Four Pillars of Destiny, the hour you were born represents the final and most personal pillar -- it also determines your ""secret animal"". This is thought to be the truest representation of yourself, the self that has been covered by layers and layers of nurture and environment. It is also used to represent information about your kids or your senior years.

How to Read Your Chinese Horoscope: 13 Steps (with Pictures),Know if you're yin or yang.,"There's a few things to consider here:Every year is either yin or yang. Odd years are yang and even years are yin. Whatever the current year is, it's that side of the spectrum that tends to get emphasized.Every sign is yin or yang as well. This is the side of your personality that naturally has more power -- though anything can change in alignment with the stars.Yin is associate with passivity, cold, femininity, submissive, dark energy. Yang represents activity, heat, masculinity, aggressiveness, and light energy. Before you go assuming the worst, know that everyone has both -- it's just a cycle. You start with yin, say, until it blooms and turns into yang. And take into account the year's yin or yang, too!"

Just take the last number in the year of your birth![6]0 or 1: Metal2 or 3: Water4 or 5: Wood6 or 7: Fire8 or 9: EarthWhat does this mean? Again, it's a cycle, this part emphasizing movement and change. Whatever element you are will naturally be emphasized, but how does it mix with the element of the current year? It is believed that the element of the year is the dominant one -- some years will work with your element, while others will work against, creating harmony and disharmony.There are believed to be two cycles: the creative cycle and the destructive cycle.For example, water destroys fire but produces wood and so forth. Each element affects others in different ways, ideally creating a perfect balance.It is believed that the elements line up with the 4 seasons. Wood is the strongest in spring, fire in summer, Earth during the season transitions, and so on.Each element is dominant for 2 years in a row. The cycle repeats every 10 years (there being 5 elements and all)."
How to Read Your Chinese Horoscope: 13 Steps (with Pictures),Know the Ten Heavenly Stems and Twelve Earthly Branches.,"You have your own complicated sign, but the years have more detail to them too; each one has a stem paired with a branch. For example, the year 2002 has a Yang Water Stem on the Horse Branch. The horse branch has not only Yin Fire behind it, but Yin Earth too. It's how your pillars fit into every year that determines your cyclical fate.[7]The Ten Heavenly stems are a combination of yin and yang and the Five Elements. Therefore, your options are Yang Wood, Yin Wood, Yang Fire, Yin Fire , Yang Earth, Yin Earth, Yang Metal, Yin Metal, Yang Water, Yin Water.These go in a 60-year cycle as discussed above. Year 1 was Rat Yang Wood; year 61 will be the same, cycling through with no repetitions before that.The Twelve Earthly Branches are the Zodiac animals discussed in the first section.

"How to Revive Dried Out Markers: Dry-Erase, Sharpies, & More",Pull out and flip the marker nib if you need a quick fix.,"Pinch the soft felt nib with a pair of needlenose pliers and pull it straight out from the marker. Turn the nib 180 degrees so the part that was inside of the marker now points out. Then, carefully push the nib back into the end of the marker so its ready to use again.[1]This works best for dry-erase markers that have a chisel-shaped nib.Work over a sink or put some paper towels down in case leftover ink comes out from the end of the marker.The ink will soak through the dried end of the tip again, so you can try flipping the nib if the marker ever dries out again."
"How to Revive Dried Out Markers: Dry-Erase, Sharpies, & More",Swing the marker on a piece of string to move the ink to the tip.,"Put the cap on your marker and make sure its secured tightly. Wrap a piece of string or dental floss around the end of your marker. Secure the string with a piece of masking tape, leaving about 12 feet (3061cm) of loose string. Hold onto the end of the string and spin the marker over your head like a lasso for 1015 seconds.[2]The force from spinning your marker will push all of the ink to the tip so you can get a little more life out of it.You may be able to get similar results just by shaking the marker in your hand.If you need to revive multiple dry-erase markers, put them in a cup with the tip side down. Tape the string to the outside of the cup and quickly spin it around. The force from spinning the cup will keep the markers from falling out."
"How to Revive Dried Out Markers: Dry-Erase, Sharpies, & More",Add more ink to your marker if its refillable.,"Get a dry erase ink refill for the color of your marker. Unscrew the tip from the main barrel of the marker and set it vertically on your table. Use a dropper to add the ink to the marker barrel until its full. Screw the tip tightly back onto the marker.[3]If your marker doesnt come apart, getting a new marker may be the best solution."
"How to Revive Dried Out Markers: Dry-Erase, Sharpies, & More",Soak the tip of the marker in rubbing alcohol to rewet it.,"Fill a small bowl with 90% rubbing alcohol so you have enough to submerge the tip of your marker. Keep your marker vertical so the tip points down and dunk the tip in the alcohol. Leave the marker until you see the ink start to run in the liquid. Then, just take the marker out, put a cap on it, and let it sit for 15 minutes before using it again.[4]Tape your marker to the edge of the bowl or lean it up against something so it stays upright."
"How to Revive Dried Out Markers: Dry-Erase, Sharpies, & More",Pour rubbing alcohol inside the marker to draw out leftover ink.,Grip the end of the permanent marker just above the nib with a pair of needlenose pliers. Gently pull the tip off of the main barrel of the marker to expose the ink pad inside. Fill a dropper with your rubbing alcohol and squeeze a few drops into the opening at the end of the ink pad. Push the pieces of your marker back together and wait 12 minutes before using it again.[5]Be careful handling the ink pad since it could get permanent marker ink on your skin.
"How to Revive Dried Out Markers: Dry-Erase, Sharpies, & More",Store your marker with the cap on and tip pointed down to keep it wet.,"Permanent markers and alcohol-based felt-tip markers can dry out when you store them horizontally or upright with the tip face-up. Put the caps tightly on your markers and set them with the tip down in a cup or pencil holder. That way, gravity pulls the ink to the nib so its ready to use.[6]"
"How to Revive Dried Out Markers: Dry-Erase, Sharpies, & More",Dip the tip of the marker in warm water before using it to easily rewet the tip.,"Keep a small bowl of warm water near you whenever you need to use your markers. If the marker is dried out and not writing well, quickly dunk the tip in warm water and shake off the excess. The water will help the ink move through the dry nib so its easier to write with.[7]This also works well for highlighters since theyre water-based.When youre finished using your markers, dip the tips in the water for 5 seconds before putting the cap on them. Then wait 1 day before using them again.[8]"
"How to Revive Dried Out Markers: Dry-Erase, Sharpies, & More",Try spraying a glycerin solution on the nib for a quick refresher.,Fill a small spray bottle with 1 part glycerin and 3 parts water. Spritz the tip of your marker with your glycerin solution right before you use it to help the ink move through the nib smoothly.[9]
"How to Revive Dried Out Markers: Dry-Erase, Sharpies, & More",Pour water into the marker to rewet any leftover ink.,"Grip the nib with a pair of needlenose pliers and carefully pull it straight out from the end of the marker. Hold the marker vertically and splash a few drops of water into the barrel and onto the nib. Then, just push the nib back into the end of the marker and try using it again.[10]Avoid completely filling the marker with water since it will dilute the ink and make it less visible."
"How to Revive Dried Out Markers: Dry-Erase, Sharpies, & More",Store the marker with the tip pointed down to revive the marker in 1 day.,"When youre finished using the marker, put the cap on tightly and put it in a cup or pencil holder so it stays vertical. After a day, gravity will help any of the remaining ink flow into the nib so you get a little extra life out of your markers.[11]"
How to Create a Paint Booth in Your Garage (with Pictures),Measure to figure out the dimensions of your paint booth.,"Your project needs and the size of your garage will determine how big your booth needs to be.  An 8-foot (2.43m) wide paint booth is suitable for  garage or a large patio, for instance, and it will typically fit a full car inside it. However, an 8 by 4 feet (2.4 by 1.2m) will be big enough for most other projects, which will be the example used below.A single-car garage is typically 9 to 10 feet (2.7 to 3.0m) across, as an example, though they can be as big as 12 or 14 feet (3.7 or 4.3m) across."
How to Create a Paint Booth in Your Garage (with Pictures),Sketch out a frame to determine how much pipe you'll need.,"The frame will need vertical pipe in each corner, as well as vertical supports in the back wall and both side walls. It will also need horizontal pieces all around the top, as well as around the middle in the back and on the sides.[1]For instance, for the example project, you'll need 9 10 feet (3.0m) sections of PVC pipe with a diameter of 1.25 inches (3.2cm). This diameter is sturdy enough for most projects. PVC pipe is typically sold in sections that are 10 feet (3.0m) long."
How to Create a Paint Booth in Your Garage (with Pictures),Determine the lengths of pipe you need to make your booth.,"Divide the sides into 2 sections at the top for the extra support. Also, divide the middle pole across the top of the booth into 2 sections for the extra vertical support in the middle. Decide what you want the height of your booth to be, taking into account the height of your garage. Keep in mind, the poles for height will be divided into 2 sections as well. Mark on your sketch how long you want each section to be. The most important thing is that all the parallel pipes are equal across the booth.For the example design, the sections you need are as follows:3 8-foot (2.43 m) sections1 5-foot, 11 3/4-inch (1.82 m) section2 4-foot (1.22 m) sections2 3-foot, 11 7/8-inch (1.22) sections6 3-foot (0.91 m) sections2 2-foot, 7 3/4-inch (0.806 m) sections2 26 3/8-inch (0.67 m) sections2 20-inch (0.51 m) sections8 2 1/2-inch (6.35 cm) sections"
How to Create a Paint Booth in Your Garage (with Pictures),Mark the points on the pipe where you'll need to cut.,Gather your pipe up and measure out each piece you'll need. Use a permanent marker to designate where to cut on each piece. Lay out your pipe to make sure it looks right before you cut it.[2]
How to Create a Paint Booth in Your Garage (with Pictures),Cut the pieces to length according to the marks you made.,"Secure the pipe in a small workbench with 2 planks on each side acting as a vise or with a table-mounted vise. Use a PVC saw or clamp-style pipe cutter to saw through the pipe by slicing right through the marks you made on the pipe. Slide the saw back and forth while applying light pressure downward to cut through it.[3]To clean up the ends of the pipe, rub them down with a sanding block.A simple hacksaw can also cut through PVC pipe.[4]"
How to Create a Paint Booth in Your Garage (with Pictures),Lay out the pipes how they will go together.,"Place elbows at the corners and T connectors where 3 pipes meet. You'll also need small sections to attach the T connectors to the elbows at the corners.Check the 3-foot (0.91 m) pipes and choose the ones that have most even ends. These will form the 4 posts at the corners that touch the floor. Lay out 2 more in the front on each side to form the top of these posts, then the 2 2-foot, 7 3/4-inch (0.806 m) sections in the back for the top of these posts.The 3 8-foot (2.43 m) sections go along the top horizontally in front and back and along the middle of the wall in back, while the 5-foot, 11 3/4-inch (1.82 m) section goes vertically in the middleOn the sides, the 4-foot (1.22 m) sections form the middle horizontal poles, while the 26 3/8-inch (0.67 m) will make the front half the horizontal section at the top and the 2 20-inch (0.51 m) will make the back part of this section."
How to Create a Paint Booth in Your Garage (with Pictures),Attach a T connector and elbow connector to the top of each corner pole.,"Start with the front corner. Place a T-connector on top of a 3-foot (0.91 m), then use a small piece of pipe (the 2 1/2-inch [6.35 cm] sections) in the joint extending toward the front. Attach an elbow connector with this small piece of pipe. That will be the support for the front pole along the top. Do the same for the smaller 2-foot, 73/4-inch (0.806 m) sections that will form the top of the poles in the back, except the elbow connector will extend along the back.[5]Ask for help with assembly if possible!"
How to Create a Paint Booth in Your Garage (with Pictures),Build the rest of the corner posts with T connectors.,"On the front, connect the top to the 3-foot (0.91 m) bottom with 1 T connector  with the opening facing toward the back of the booth. In the back, use a small piece of pipe to connect 2 T connectors in the middle of the post. Face one toward the front and one pointing along the back side."
How to Create a Paint Booth in Your Garage (with Pictures),Build the sides using the corner posts and more connectors.,"At the top, connect the front corner pole to 1 26 3/8-inch (0.67 m) section. Add a T connector, then 1 20-inch (0.51 m) section. Stick the other end of this section into the back corner pole. Place 1 4-foot (1.22 m) section across the middle of the side connect the front pole to the back pole halfway down. Find the T connector in the middle of the side at the top. Use a small piece of pipe to connect an elbow joint to it that's facing toward the middle. [6]Do the same with the other side."
How to Create a Paint Booth in Your Garage (with Pictures),Connect the sides with the longer poles.,"Build a post for the middle of the booth by sliding 1 5-foot, 11 3/4-inch (1.82 m) section into the bottom of a T connector. Add 1 3-foot, 11 7/8-inch (1.22) section to either side of the connector. Push the smaller sections into the middle of the walls at either end at the top. Add the 8-foot (2.43 m) sections at the top in the front, the top in the back, and the middle in the back.Don't fully secure these joints until all the poles are in place."
How to Create a Paint Booth in Your Garage (with Pictures),Secure each pipe by fully inserting it into the PVC joint.,"It is extremely difficult to break PVC pipe or joints with your bare hands, so apply plenty of pressure to ensure a tight fit. Press the pipe in to each joint. You may need to twist the pipe slightly to get everything connected tightly."
How to Create a Paint Booth in Your Garage (with Pictures),Lay a 10 by 25ft (3.0 by 7.6m) piece of plastic sheeting over the whole booth.,"Place it so the long piece goes up one side, over the top, and down the other side. Draw enough to the back to completely cover it. Leave just enough over the front to pull over the pipes, about 1 foot (0.30m) or so.[7]"
How to Create a Paint Booth in Your Garage (with Pictures),Trim and tape the plastic along the back.,"Use clamps to hold the plastic in place while you're working on it if you have them. Make sure the bottom of the plastic is even with the bottom of your booth, then cut the plastic along the corner pole straight up from the bottom to the corner at the top. Tape the edge of the plastic around the corner pole with duct tape.[8]If you're having trouble with tape sticking properly, place the tape over the plastic and pole. Then, poke a hole through the plastic and tape on the inner side of the pole. Run a zip tie through the hole around the pole, tape, and plastic. Secure the zip tie to help hold the plastic in place."
How to Create a Paint Booth in Your Garage (with Pictures),Cut and tape down the plastic on the sides in the back.,"Flatten the piece of plastic on the side and then cut up from the bottom to the corner at the top in a straight line. Tape the edge of the plastic to the pole in back, sealing off the edge by going all along it with tape. Do the same for the other back corner.[9]You should have cut a large square out of the corner of the plastic on each side. Save these for the front."
How to Create a Paint Booth in Your Garage (with Pictures),Tape the front of the plastic in place.,"Pull the overhang in front taut, and tape it against itself and onto the poles in front. Hang the pieces of plastic you cut out of the back in front, taping them along the top and on the front corner poles. This should cover the whole front. Seal off the seams completely with tape.[10]Leave the opening between the 2 sheets in the front, except seal it a little at the top and bottom. When you get in the booth to paint, close this seam tightly with clamps.If the plastic doesn't cover the front, you may need to get another sheet of plastic to cover the front."
How to Create a Paint Booth in Your Garage (with Pictures),Lay down a 4 by 15 feet (1.2 by 4.6m) drop cloth inside the booth.,"Position it so that the corners rest on each leg of the paint booth. Make sure it is flat by pushing out any creases or bubbles. Then lift each of the paint booth's legs up one at a time to push the drop cloth edges under each leg.[11]If the cloth doesn't fit right or it doesn't line-up under the paint booth's legs, step back to inspect the legs. Each leg should be near-perpendicular to the ground. Adjust as needed."
How to Create a Paint Booth in Your Garage (with Pictures),Secure the plastic sheeting on the inside.,"Tape it to the corners of the booth inside, as well as the drop cloth. Start on one side, attaching the plastic to the drop cloth with the duct tape, using strips to completely seal the seams. This will hold the plastic and drop cloth in place.[12]"
How to Create a Paint Booth in Your Garage (with Pictures),Create a structure for a box fan.,"Using a small stepladder, cardboard boxes, or other temporary structure, place a box fan high enough to at least clear the middle PVC pipe of your paint booth. Position the structure outside of the booth on one side.If necessary because of limited space, place the structure so that it is approximately 1 inch (2.5cm) from the middle PVC pipe. This will place the legs of the ladder inside the booth, but they will be covered by plastic."
How to Create a Paint Booth in Your Garage (with Pictures),Cut a hole for the fan.,"Trim a hole that's almost exactly the size of the fan at the height you've got it. Pull the plastic to the edge of the fan and seal it all around with tape. If you need to, add extra plastic to make sure you get a tight seal."
How to Create a Paint Booth in Your Garage (with Pictures),Face the fan toward the inside of the booth.,"You're creating positive pressure, meaning you'll blow air in and let it out in another filter. If you pulled air from the paint booth through the fan instead, you could end up drawing dangerous fumes into the fan's motor."
How to Create a Paint Booth in Your Garage (with Pictures),Tape a furnace filter to the back of the fan.,"You don't want to blow dust into the booth, so find a filter that's the same size as the fan. Seal it to the back of the fan using duct tape.You can also do the opposite if you prefer. That is, you can tape a filter into the side of the booth instead of the back of the fan. Then, just face the fan toward the filter."
How to Create a Paint Booth in Your Garage (with Pictures),Mount a furnace filter in the plastic with duct tape.,"Cut a hole in the plastic large enough for a filter on the side opposite the fan. Tape it in place to the plastic, making sure you seal all the edges with tape.When using the paint booth, always run the fan."
How to Create a Paint Booth in Your Garage (with Pictures),Replace your filters regularly.,"The furnace filters will eventually fill with overspray and paint dust. Each time the filter is changed, either pull up the existing duct tape holding it in place or cut it out with a blade. If you're using a blade, be careful not to cut the plastic!It may be helpful to add the new filter with a different color duct tape each time so you know which tape to remove or cut without touching the wrong tape."

How to Prepare Yourself for EMDR Therapy: 12 Steps (with Pictures),Know what to expect.,"EMDR therapy is not a one-time treatment. It utilizes an eight-phase approach to psychotherapy, and requires the patient to recall painful memories while the therapist guides them through a series of eye movements.[2] Each set of eye movements lasts approximately 30 seconds, and is designed to replicate the mechanisms that take place during Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep. EMDR therapy helps patients deal with a traumatic past, but it can also help cope with present circumstances and even plan for future events. Studies have shown that eye movements help disrupt working memory.[3]The combination of exposure therapy and eye movement help the patient's brain process the traumatic memories. This changes the trauma from what's considered a ""stuck memory"" into a resolved learning experience, after which the patient is able to let go of the feelings of trauma.[4]EMDR has a high rate of success, when patients complete the entire course of treatment. Some patients are able to process a single traumatic event in as few as three sessions, while other patients need 12 or more sessions to fully process an event. Every patient is different, and for maximum results you should adhere to your therapist's recommendations."
How to Prepare Yourself for EMDR Therapy: 12 Steps (with Pictures),Learn if EMDR will help you.,"EMDR was originally designed to primarily treat PTSD, but the scope of treatment has expanded somewhat over time. There is some anecdotal evidence which suggests that EMDR may be useful in treating phobias and panic disorders, but researchers have failed to find any strong clinical success in the use of EMDR for these conditions.EMDR is most effective at treating PTSD and trauma from assault, combat, or life-threatening situations. However, EMDR may be effective at treating other anxiety disorders, if those disorders originated in response to a traumatic incident.If you think EMDR therapy might be right for you, talk to your doctor or contact an EMDR-qualified therapist for a consultation."
How to Prepare Yourself for EMDR Therapy: 12 Steps (with Pictures),Find an EMDR-qualified therapist.,"It is vital that therapists be formally trained in EMDR therapy. The memories brought up in EMDR therapy are often traumatic, life-threatening events, and it is imperative that the therapist knows how to properly administer treatment and help the patient cope with these memories. If the therapist is not formally trained in EMDR, the treatment could be ineffective, or even harmful.Ask your prospective therapist if they have received both levels of EMDR training, and whether that training was through an EMDRIA-approved institution.Ensure that the prospective therapist is up to date on the latest EMDR protocols and practices.Ask the prospective therapist how many cases they have treated with the problem for which you are seeking treatment, and what their success rate has been for those cases.To find a qualified EMDR therapist in the United States or Canada, visit the Psychology Today search engine at https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/prof_search.php.

How to Prepare Yourself for EMDR Therapy: 12 Steps (with Pictures),Anticipate a slow start.,"Before the actual EMDR therapy begins, the patient and therapist begin a period of preparation. This is important for the patients health and the success of the therapy, as the therapist teaches the patient various techniques to cope with the traumatic memories discussed during therapy. These techniques should ultimately help the patient to control or soothe their emotional response to the painful and traumatic memories that will arise during subsequent sessions.The preparation phase will vary, depending on the patient and their ability to manage the trauma. Many therapists feel that the patient is typically ready after one or two initial sessions, but the decision to move forward is at the discretion of the therapist. The end of the preparation phase will ultimately be determined by the perceived preparedness of the patient."
How to Prepare Yourself for EMDR Therapy: 12 Steps (with Pictures),Avoid wearing contact lenses.,"Due to the rapid eye movements associated with EMDR therapy, patients eyes often become dried out during sessions.

These are available at most pharmacies and drug stores, and can help rejuvenate dry eyes or prevent them altogether."
How to Prepare Yourself for EMDR Therapy: 12 Steps (with Pictures),Prepare to bring up painful memories.,"The point of EMDR therapy is to allow the patient to better process memories of a traumatic experience.

How to Prepare Yourself for EMDR Therapy: 12 Steps (with Pictures),Plan to relax afterward.,"Because EMDR therapy involves the evocation of painful or unpleasant memories, it is recommended that patients take the rest of the day off after a session, if at all possible. Some experts recommend trying to take a nap at home after the session ends. This is both to help soothe the patient after recalling upsetting memories, and to continue the processing that was begun during the EMDR session.If you can, try to schedule your sessions for days on which you will not have to return to work. Its important to give yourself time immediately after your EMDR session to relax and process the emotions that arise during therapy."
How to Prepare Yourself for EMDR Therapy: 12 Steps (with Pictures),Anticipate a post-session emotional response.,"Many patients experience upsetting emotional responses for several days after a session, with some particularly strong responses lasting several weeks. These responses are normal, and should simply be recounted to your therapist at the start of your next session. Some patients experience extreme responses that trigger depressive episodes, and these incidents should be reported to the therapist immediately to ensure the safety of the patient. Common responses in the days after a session include:feelings of insightvivid or upsetting dreamsstrong emotionsrecalling memories that had been blocked or forgotten"
How to Prepare Yourself for EMDR Therapy: 12 Steps (with Pictures),Follow your appointment schedule.,"Studies have shown that patients who do not complete the full eight-phase course of treatment are more likely to lose the beneficial effects of treatment, or lack any significant benefits whatsoever. For this reason, it is imperative that you commit to the full course of treatment, if you or your therapist believes that EMDR treatments could help you.Phase one - this phase of therapy involves the therapist taking down the patient's history. The therapist will then assess the patient's preparedness to progress, and will work with the patient to develop a treatment plan.Phase two - during the second phase of treatment, the therapist will work with the patient to ensure that they have multiple methods of coping with emotional pain and trauma. During this phase, the therapist may teach the patient different stress-reduction techniques and develop a plan to process disturbing emotions as they arise.Phases three through six - in these phases of treatment, the patient will identify some type of vivid visual imagery they associate with the traumatic memory, a negative belief they hold about themselves, a positive belief they hold about themselves, and any other emotions or sensations related to the memory. Sessions during these phases will focus on the use of eye movement. The therapist will also teach the patient to focus on the positive self-belief that they have identified.Phase seven - during phase seven, the therapist works with the patient to find some type of closure on the trauma. If the therapist has not done so yet, they will now begin asking the patient to keep a log throughout the week, and will work on instituting the self-calming and coping techniques from phase two for use at home when the patient is keeping their weekly log.Phase eight - in this (potentially) last phase, the therapist will review how much progress the patient has made and evaluate how to move forward."
How to Prepare Yourself for EMDR Therapy: 12 Steps (with Pictures),Be open and honest.,"In many ways, the course of each EMDR session is determined by the patient. The patient is always left in charge of deciding how much to tell the therapist in a given session, and whether they feel comfortable continuing or would prefer to stop. But through it all, its important that you offer your therapist total honesty in everything you discuss.If you need to stop or dont yet feel comfortable proceeding on a certain topic, that is perfectly fine. However, in order to fully move past the trauma of the event, you will eventually need to open up about all aspects of the experience.As a patient, you have every right to withhold details or memories until youre more comfortable revealing that information, but its important to know that prolonged withholding of information will extend the duration of the therapy, and may delay the healing process."
How to Prepare Yourself for EMDR Therapy: 12 Steps (with Pictures),Develop new coping skills.,"Though the memories of trauma will continue to live on in the patients mind, a successful course of EMDR therapy should help reduce or completely eliminate the distressing symptoms that had previously accompanied those memories. Once the memory no longer causes flashbacks, panic attacks, or symptoms of trauma, the therapist and patient will begin to develop new coping skills to help process and live with those memories, as well as any future trauma that may arise."

If you're speaking directly to the person, you would use the object pronoun for ""you.""[7]The phrase ""me haces falta"" is an exception, because you use the object pronoun for yourself, me, instead of the object pronoun for the person to whom you're speaking.The Spanish language has formal and informal variations of you. If you are speaking to someone with whom you are not on familiar terms, you would use the formal variation.Generally, you wouldn't be saying ""I miss you"" to someone with whom you're not close. For this reason, the word te is most commonly used in Spanish phrases meaning ""I miss you."" This word is the direct object pronoun for the second person familiar t, meaning ""you."" Since this is the familiar form of the word ""you,"" it should only be used with friends and family.If for some reason you need to express this sentiment to someone with whom you're not on familiar terms, replace te with lo (masculine) or la (feminine). These are the formal object pronouns for usted, the polite, formal variation of ""you.""If you are speaking about missing several people (for example, if you are telling a couple that you miss them both), you would use the plural direct object pronoun for ""you,"" which is os."

4 Ways to Do Footnotes - wikiHow,Use the same font for footnotes as the rest of the paper.,"Generally, you should use the same font for your entire paper rather than using several different fonts. The default font on your word processing app is usually fine.[2]"
4 Ways to Do Footnotes - wikiHow,Place the footnote number after closing punctuation.,"In most cases, a footnote occurs at the end of the sentence with the information that you want to cite or discuss. Some style guides provide for a number after the closing punctuation, followed by a period. In others, superscript numbers are preferred.[3]You'll typically only have one footnote per sentence. If you need more than one footnote, place the other footnote at the end of the sentence clause it relates to, outside the closing punctuation. The only exception is if the sentence is broken up by a long dash, in which case, the superscript number goes before the beginning of the dash.[4]"
4 Ways to Do Footnotes - wikiHow,Use sequential numbers for footnotes throughout your paper.,"Footnote numbers count up from ""1"" throughout your paper  they do not start over at the beginning of each page. Each footnote has its own number, even if it is citing the same source as a previous footnote.[5]For some longer papers, such as doctoral theses, footnote numbers may start over with each chapter. If you're unsure if this is appropriate for your project, discuss it with your editor or advisor.Most word processing apps will maintain sequential numbering for you, provided you use the app's function for inserting footnotes, rather than trying to type the numbers manually."
4 Ways to Do Footnotes - wikiHow,Insert footnotes using your word processing app.,"Most word processing apps have a function you can use to easily add footnotes to your paper. This function is usually included under the ""insert"" or ""references"" listing on your app's menu bar.[6]You typically have formatting options that allow you to choose numbers, letters, or other symbols to indicate footnotes. You can also change the size or placement of footnotes, although the default option is usually appropriate."
4 Ways to Do Footnotes - wikiHow,Write your bibliography page before placing footnotes.,"Citations in footnotes typically are shortened versions of the full citation that can be found in your bibliography or Works Cited at the end of your paper. Writing out the full citation first makes it easier to create your footnotes, and ensures that you've included all sources you used.[7]For most style guides, the use of footnotes does not replace the need for a list of references at the end of your paper. Even if a full list of references isn't strictly required, it can help place your paper in context."
4 Ways to Do Footnotes - wikiHow,Type a citation for the source following the appropriate style guide.,"While the basic information included in a citation is almost always the same, different style guides have slightly different formats. Generally, you'll list the author's name first, followed by the title of the source. Include publication information, then close with the page number where the material you quoted or paraphrased appears.[8]For example, suppose you've paraphrased information from a book by Reginald Daily, titled Timeless wikiHow Examples: Through the Ages. If you were using Chicago style, your footnote citation would look something like this: Reginald Daily, Timeless wikiHow Examples: Through the Ages (Minneapolis: St. Olaf Press, 2010), 115."
4 Ways to Do Footnotes - wikiHow,Use shortened citations for subsequent uses of the source.,"Often, you'll cite to the same source more than once in the same paper. You typically only have to give the full footnote citation for the source once. Later citations include the author's last name, a shortened version of the title, and the page number where the material you quoted or paraphrased can be found.[9]For example, suppose later on in your paper you need to cite Reginald Daily's wikiHow book again. Your shortened citation might look something like this: Daily, wikiHow Examples, 130."
4 Ways to Do Footnotes - wikiHow,Separate multiple citations with semi-colons.,"Sometimes, a sentence requires a citation to more than one source. Place a single footnote at the end of the sentence and include the citations to both sources in the same footnote, rather than having 2 footnotes at the end of the sentence.[10]For example, suppose you have a sentence in your text comparing the conclusions in Reginald Daily's book with the observations in another book on the same topic. Your footnote might look something like this: Reginald Daily, Timeless wikiHow Examples: Through the Ages (Minneapolis: St. Olaf Press, 2010), 115; Mary Beth Miller, The wiki Revolution (New York: New Tech Press, 2018), 48."
4 Ways to Do Footnotes - wikiHow,Include signal phrases to explain relationships between sources.,"Signal words and phrases, such as ""but see"" or ""see also"" let your readers know that there are other authors who agree or disagree with the information in the original source you cited. Typically, you would use the additional source to establish the relative reliability of the source you cited.[11]For example, if Miller's work reached a conclusion that was contrary to the conclusion Daily reached, your footnote might look something like this: Reginald Daily, Timeless wikiHow Examples: Through the Ages (Minneapolis: St. Olaf Press, 2010), 115; but see Mary Beth Miller, The wiki Revolution (New York: New Tech Press, 2018), 48.If you believe it would be helpful to your readers, you can add a brief parenthetical comment after the second source that explains why you included it."
4 Ways to Do Footnotes - wikiHow,Add contextual information if necessary.,"A citation footnote may include nothing but the citation. However, occasionally you may need to explain something about the source or its relation to your paper.[12]For example, suppose you want to include a brief explanation as to why you're citing Daily's book, despite the fact that it was published in 2010. Your footnote might look something like this: Reginald Daily, Timeless wikiHow Examples: Through the Ages (Minneapolis: St. Olaf Press, 2010), 115. Although published in 2010, Daily's work provides a jumping-off point for research in this area."
4 Ways to Do Footnotes - wikiHow,Include bibliographic notes in MLA papers.,"MLA style discourages the use of footnotes generally. However, footnotes are allowed when you want to point your readers to other publications where a topic is discussed more thoroughly.[13]For example, there may be a basic concept that is beyond the scope of your paper, but important for your readers to understand. You could add a footnote that says ""For an explanation of the theory of relativity, see generally"" followed by a source or list of sources.Typically, these types of footnotes provide your reader with information on something that is tangential to your paper but could be important to help your readers understand the topic as a whole or place your paper in context."
4 Ways to Do Footnotes - wikiHow,Use footnotes for asides that would ruin the flow of your writing.,"Tangential or parenthetical comments can interrupt your main text and potentially confuse readers. If you want to make a side comment about something, put it out of the way in a footnote so it doesn't distract readers from the point of your paper.[14]Some style guides, such as MLA and APA, instruct that parenthetical statements should be included in the main text of your paper, rather than in footnotes.[15]"
4 Ways to Do Footnotes - wikiHow,"Provide working definitions, explanations, or clarifications.","Sometimes you need to provide additional information so that your readers will understand exactly what a source means. You might also need to explain the significance of something mentioned in your source that isn't common knowledge.[16]These types of footnotes frequently accompany a quote from a source and may include a citation to the source. For example, if you quoted a source that discussed wikiHow, and you wanted to clarify, you might add a footnote that says ""wikiHow examples are used to clarify text in situations where it would be helpful to have a visual cue. Reginald Daily, Timeless wikiHow Examples: Through the Ages (Minneapolis: St. Olaf Press, 2010), 115."""
4 Ways to Do Footnotes - wikiHow,Offer quotes or additional commentary to give your paper depth.,"Sometimes a source may include a quote that you find particularly compelling, but that you just can't fit into your main text. There might also be information in your text that you want to make a comment about that is beyond the scope of your paper.[17]For example, suppose you are writing a paper about the use of wikiHow articles as sources, and you include a study finding that wikiHow articles are more accurate than articles on major news sites about similar topics. You might add a footnote that says ""Despite this fact, the vast majority of professors at public universities in the US do not accept wikiHow articles as sources for research papers.""You can also use footnotes to make a witty remark, which can add humor and lightheartedness to your paper. However, these types of footnotes should be used extremely rarely, and only when appropriate to the subject matter."
